        <content>(CNN) -- A 67-year-old woman who reportedly received millions in life insurance money from at least five of her previous partners has been arrested on suspicion of poisoning her last husband with cyanide -- the latest high-profile case in Japan involving so-called "black widows."Chisako Kakehi, who benefited to the tune of 800 million yen ($6.8 million) over the past 20 years, according to Japanese media, denies any wrongdoing."I didn't kill him. I don't know how to kill ..." she told police, according to CNN affiliate TV Asahi.But an autopsy report on Iso Kakehi, her fourth husband to die, found cyanide in his stomach and blood.The 75-year old died in December, less than two months after their wedding. It triggered a police investigation into the case, which culminated in Kakehi's arrest in Kyoto on Wednesday.A previous fiancé, who died when he crashed his motorcycle, was also found to have traces of cyanide in his body.Police would only say "many" of her previous partners -- who were aged between 54 and 75 -- had died in the past two decades.Autopsies rareHowever, authorities may be unable to prove she killed her other lovers because autopsies are generally rare in Japan. Her first husband died back in 1994.Kakehi is the latest "black widow" to make the headlines in Japan. Kanae Kijima is currently in prison after being found guilty of killing three men she met on dating websites in 2009 and making it look like suicide in each case. She was 37 at the time.That same year, bar worker Miyuki Ueta, 40, was found guilty of drugging and drowning two men she reportedly owed money to.Both are appealing death sentences.</content>

        <author>By Kocha Olarn and Greg Botelho, CNN</author>
        <content>Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- What would Katniss do?The central figure in "The Hunger Games," the hit sci-fi series about an oppressed people's struggle against a totalitarian regime, is being evoked for real, now, in Thailand among university students expressing their opposition to that southeast Asian nation's military rulers.Several students, from Bangkok to about 450 kilometers (280 miles) away to the northeast, have been detained in recent days after flashing the signature anti-establishment, three-fingered salute from"The Hunger Games."By Thursday evening, all of those held had been released, according to lawyers. At that point, according to Human Rights Watch's Sunai Phasuk, about 100 police and military troops had congregated then at a busy cinema in the Thai capital where "The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1" was set to debut.'Prohibited by martial law'Asked about the arrests of students who flashed the salute and others accused of organizing a protest meeting revolving around the Jennifer Lawrence-starring movie, a government official told CNN that the "military is working on reducing conflicts from various political groups." Allowing such political statements, he said, could inflame tensions in the unsettled nation."Seeing a movie is a personal thing, and they all have a right to do that," said Maj. Gen. Sansern Kaewkumnerd. "But if, after seeing the movie, there are political activities involved, this is prohibited by martial law, which has been imposed since (last May's) military intervention."Sansern added, "If we allow one group to hold political activities, then (other) groups would want to do the same thing. We would never achieve peace and order, which we are trying to restore."Yet there's little indication the opposition is going away, nor is there anything like national elections on the immediate horizon suggesting a return to civilian rule.Military takes over in ThailandOpposition uses pop cultureSuch political turmoil is hardly new to Thailand. Its military has attempted 19 coups -- 12 of them successful -- in the past 80 years.The world, of course, has changed a lot over that time, as have the tools and inspirations of opposition groups.One protest leader, Sombat Boonngamanong, has been especially pivotal in using pop culture references straight out of Hollywood to spread the movement's message.That includes the story of Katniss Everdeen -- a teenage girl who competes in a spectacle of blood lust known as the Hunger Games and becomes a leader in the revolution against a tyrannical government.A "Hunger Games" fan club, which consists of university students calling for democracy in Thailand, had planned to meet for the latest film's showing Thursday at one Bangkok theater.But the showing at that theater and three others that are part of the same Apex chain was canceled -- for "technical" reasons, according to the chain.Ratthapon Supasopon, from the League of Liberal Thammasart for Democracy, said the theater's management gave them refunds for tickets they had bought in advance. That meant they couldn't watch the movie there, but -- with it opening elsewhere around Thailand -- the group still planned to meet and see the film somewhere else.Some detained students sign agreementA young activist, Bangkok University student Natchacha Kongudom, was taken to a police station and then to a military facility for flashing the Hunger Games salute at a Bangkok cinema, according to her friend Ratthapon. Natchacha was let go hours later, after signing an agreement promising not to take part in future political activities, human rights lawyer Anond Numpa said.Five Khon Kaen University students were asked to sign the same such agreement Thursday, a day after they were detained for eight hours after throwing up the three-fingered salute while wearing shirts bearing the words "Don't want a military coup."Video from CNN affiliate Channel 3 shows students being led away by authorities, a few feet from Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, after revealing their shirts and holding their fingers aloft."It is OK, just gently take them away, we will definitely take care of them," Prayuth said from a stage, where he was addressing civil servants. "This just makes things more difficult if we don't understand each other."The grinning Prime Minister then elicits laughs by saying, "Anyone else want to protest?"Two of the students ending up signing the agreement vowing not to partake in political activities, but the others refused. After intense talks, those three were let go without any conditions -- though by then they didn't want to go home out of fear of the military, according to Phavinee Chumsri, from the group Thai Lawyers for Human Rights.Invited to have an 'attitude adjustment'Sansern, the military government's spokesman, said Prayuth -- who was the army's chief before taking over as prime minister following the May coup -- told him what happened in Khon Kaen was "very minor" and that he thinks "they are still very young.""When they grow up they will understand in what we are doing," Sansern said, summarizing Prayuth's sentiments.As to how the government is handling dissent, the major general insisted the "military have been very lenient toward these activists.""We'll try to negotiate first, but if they still refuse to listen to us, we'd try to convince them through their parents," he said. "And lastly, we would invite them to have attitude adjustment."John Sifton, Human Rights Watch's Asia Advocacy Director, thinks it's Thailand's military government that needs an adjustment."Life in Thailand is growing more absurd by the day," he says, and "all evidence suggests the so-called roadmap to democracy ... is really a roadmap to nowhere.""Someone needs to inform General Prayuth that if his system of government is threatened by young people emulating a Hollywood movie," Sifton adds, "it is (a) pretty sure sign that things need to change."CNN's Kocha Olarn reported from Bangkok and Greg Botelho wrote this story from Atlanta.</content>

        <content>New Delhi (CNN) -- A guru in India's northern Haryana state is in jail awaiting trial after 10 days of clashes between his followers and police seeking his arrest.The spiritual leader, Rampal Maharaj, was arrested Wednesday at his ashram without further resistance from his followers, said M.L. Kaushik, the regional administrative commissioner.Police said 459 people have been arrested.Also on Wednesday, Rampal's followers turned over the bodies of five women and a child who authorities believe died of illness, Haryana state Police Chief S.N. Vashisht said.Tensions started more than a week ago when the followers didn't let officers arrest Rampal, the commissioner said. The situation began to escalate, culminating in full-blown clashes.The initial order to arrest Maharaj came after he repeatedly failed to appear in court in connection with a 2006 murder case, Kaushik said.After his arrest, the guru also was charged with sedition and waging war against the state, as well as attempted murder and rioting, Haryana state Police Chief S.N. Vashisht told CNN.The guru was jailed after making a court appearance Thursday in the city of Chandigarh, and a hearing was set for November 28, Vashisht said."I am innocent. All allegations against me are false," Rampal told reporters as he was escorted out of court.Several security personnel were injured in the clashes with the guru's followers, who fired shots and pelted police with stones at the 2½-acre religious complex, police said.Police had surrounded the ashram and ordered its evacuation, cutting off the water and electricity, and warned they wouldn't leave until they had arrested Rampal.Police attempted to storm the compound on Tuesday attempting to take Rampal into custody. Television footage showed hundreds of police in riot gear aiming water cannons and tear gas at stone-throwing crowds.As many as 85 of Rampal's followers were hurt, authorities said.Thousands of the supporters left the ashram late Tuesday and into Wednesday, police said. Early Wednesday afternoon, they estimated about 5,000 people remained inside, and the situation was reported to be calmer.Ashram authorities on Wednesday handed over to authorities the bodies of five women and a child who had died recently. Police said the bodies bore no visible signs of injury."We believe they were sick and died because of lack of medical attention on time," Kaushik said.Autopsies will be performed at a nearby hospital to determine the cause of death.Rampal, 63, is a worshiper of Kabir, a 15th-century Indian mystic, according to his website.CNN's Sugam Pokharel and Harmeet Shah Singh reported from New Delhi, and Jethro Mullen wrote from Hong Kong. CNN's Greg Botelho contributed to this report.</content>

        <content>Hong Kong (CNN) -- The originators of the Occupy Central movement suggest protesters should retreat, as a new poll shows support for the movement flagging.In a random survey of 513 people conducted by the University of Hong Kong, 83% said pro-democracy protesters should cease their eight-week occupation of major roads in Hong Kong, while just 13% said the occupiers should continue."Given the backlash from the community, we have advised students to think of other forms of protest, instead of just focusing on occupations," Occupy Central co-founder Chan Kin-man told CNN."The occupation is controversial; it creates disturbance -- this is something we have to admit. We have to move to a new stage."Two-month blockadeThe protest has now blocked major roads around Hong Kong nearly two months in an attempt to pressure officials into giving Hong Kong open elections for its next leader. But neither the Beijing or Hong Kong governments have shown any willingness to compromise, and some protesters have grown agitated.Yesterday, the movement took an unusually aggressive turn when masked protesters rammed barricades and hurled concrete slabs to smash through a glass door to Hong Kong's Legislative Council building -- where the city's government meets.Protesters also charged police lines, leading police to respond with pepper spray and batons. Six were arrested, and the Hong Kong government released a statement denouncing the protesters as "violent radicals."Pro-democracy legislator Fernando Cheung, who tried unsuccessfully to stop the smashing, told CNN it was a "major setback" for the movement that has won widespread praise for its politeness and civility."I understand they wanted to scale up the action, but they didn't understand that that would only destroy the campaign."Student leader Alex Chow urged students to continue protesting nonviolently. "If we do not choose to give up, then there is still hope and we can choose to utilize different tactics, to explore ways to counter the government," he said.Uncertain futureHong Kong's High Court has issued a series of injunctions authorizing police to begin clearing protest sites. A small section of the main protest site was cleared Tuesday, and larger clearances are planned in the coming days.In the face of the impending action, protesters disagree over what should be done next.Chan and other protest leaders have proposed a "community education" campaign, in which democracy supporters would enter Hong Kong neighborhoods to sway locals to their cause.Another potential strategy is for the city's pro-democracy legislators to resign en masse. This would trigger a by-election, giving Hong Kongers a chance to demonstrate their support for the democracy movement by voting the legislators back in.Other hardline demonstrators advocate an escalation of the physical occupations -- though protest leaders discourage this.Despite the uncertainty, the movement has already exceeded all expectations, said Chan."Our original plan was people would just sit down, holding hands, and peacefully let police arrest us," he said."We expected our Occupy Central movement would only last for a few days, not weeks or months."READ MORE: Who's who in the protests?</content>

        <author>By Ray Sanchez, CNN</author>
        <content>(CNN) -- North Korea responded harshly to a United Nations draft resolution referring the reclusive regime to the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity, promising that such a move would prompt it to conduct more nuclear tests.A U.N. General Assembly committee Tuesday voted in favor of the draft resolution condemning the country's human rights record and calling for "targeted sanctions."Before the vote, Choe Myong Nam, North Korea's representative at the U.N., issued a familiar warning, saying that seeking to punish the country on human rights "is compelling us not to refrain any further from conducting nuclear tests.""The reality is the need for us to maintain powerful state capability in order to defend our people's human rights," he said. "The outrageous and unreasonable human rights campaign staged by the United States and it followers in their attempts to eliminate the state and social system of the (North Korea) is compelling us not to refrain any further from conducting nuclear tests."The 111-19 vote, with 55 abstentions, is merely a recommendation. The General Assembly does not have the power to refer the regime or its leader, Kim Jong Un, to the ICC.The non-binding measure will come up for a vote by the General Assembly in December.The authority to refer a country to the ICC lies only with the U.N. Security Council, a 15-member body charged with maintaining global security.The five permanent members at the core of the Security Council, including China and Russia, wield veto powers.Opponents of the resolution -- including China, Russia and Cuba -- said the measure was politically manipulated and would set a precedent for other nations to be targeted in the future.The North Korean representative told the U.N. gathering Tuesday that the resolution "provoked confrontation" and "failed to reflect the reality on the ground."China is likely to use its veto against the resolution. Chinese officials have repeatedly said efforts to send North Korea's leadership to the ICC "won't help improve a country's human rights condition." North Korea's longtime ally has never wavered in its support for Pyongyang.North Korea's leaders have been accused of employing murder, torture, slavery, sexual violence and mass starvation to prop up the isolated regime and exercise total control over its citizens.North Korea has repeatedly denied the existence of political camps or human rights abuses in the country, and has accused the United States and its allies of seeking to discredit and overthrow the North Korean leadership.North Korea: 'We were forced to eat grass and soil'In February, the U.N. Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in North Korea published a 400-page report documenting widespread torture and abuse, and called for urgent action, including the referral of its findings to the ICC for possible prosecution.Last month, U.S. military officials said they believe the North Koreans have the capability to mount a nuclear warhead on an intermediate or long-range missile. If true, it represents a significant increase in North Korea's quest for a long-range nuclear weapon.Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti, commander of U.S. Forces Korea, said he believes the North Koreans have the "capability" to launch an intercontinental ballistic missile, but stressed they have not tested any such device.In April, North Korea announced that it wouldn't rule out "a new form of a nuclear test" to strengthen its nuclear deterrent capabilities. Experts have speculated that that could refer to the testing of a uranium bomb.The regime in Pyongyang is known to have conducted three previous tests, all of them believed to be based on plutonium. The most recent one took place in February 2013.Opinion: Stop romancing North KoreaKim Jong Il's former bodyguard tells of beatings, starvation in prison campOpinion: Moment of truth for North Korea over human rights</content>

        <content>New Delhi, India (CNN) -- An Ebola survivor has been quarantined in India after his semen tested positive for the virus, health officials there have announced.The 26-year-old man, an Indian national, traveled to New Delhi from Liberia on November 10, almost two months after he was hospitalized in the West African nation after showing symptoms of the illness, India's health ministry said in a statement.He was released from the Liberian hospital on September 30 with documents declaring him free of clinical signs linked to Ebola, the ministry added.As a precautionary measure, Indian authorities carried out tests on his body fluids, which confirmed traces of the virus in his semen, the statement said."Currently, this person is not having any symptoms of the disease. However, he would be kept under isolation in the special health facility of (the) Delhi Airport Health Organization, till such time his body fluids test negative and he is found medically fit to be discharged," it said.Passenger surveillanceIn the wake of the first detection of the deadly virus in India, the country's health minister, J.P. Nadda, held talks with top officials from various departments, the government said.The minister advised strengthening passenger surveillance at the country's airports and seaports, the government said. He also ordered expert teams to visit states and report back to him on preparedness to deal with the virus, it added.READ: CDC fights for Ebola funding, attentionIndia's health ministry, however, urged calm. "The situation is under control and there is no need for any alarm. However, all precautions are being taken in this regard," it said in its statement.According to the ministry and doctors, patients whose blood samples test negative for Ebola after treatment continue to shed the virus in their body fluids, such as urine and semen, for variable periods. A survivor with infected semen can transmit the disease to his sexual partners, they say."There is no cure that actually kills the virus," explained Naresh Trehan, chairman and managing director of Medanta The Medicity hospital near New Delhi. Patients, he said, are treated with supportive care.Experimental vaccines and treatments for Ebola are under development, but they have not yet been fully tested for safety or effectiveness, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.READ: Clinical drug trials to start next monthHealthcare providers, Trehan emphasized, must adhere to standard safety protocols while attending to Ebola patients and survivors carrying the virus in their body fluids.India's preparationsIndia has screened thousands of passengers arriving from the Ebola-hit countries since the outbreak of the disease in West Africa."This is like a dress-rehearsal for India, and while we are already in the mode of preparation, this case will help us galvanize into action," said Hemant Thacker, a consultant physician and cardio-metabolic specialist at Mumbai's Bhatia Hospital."I believe we are theoretically prepared because we have learned the lessons from the West. That, however, doesn't mean that our medical authorities become complacent," he cautioned.</content>

        <author>By Ray Sanchez, CNN</author>
        <content>(CNN) -- A United Nations General Assembly committee Tuesday voted in favor of a draft resolution referring North Korea to the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity as well as "targeted sanctions" for rampant human rights abuses.The 111-19 vote, with 55 abstentions, is merely a recommendation. The General Assembly does not have the power to refer the regime or its leader Kim Jong Un to the ICC.The non-binding measure will come up for a vote by the General Assembly in December.The authority to refer a country to the ICC lies only with the U.N. Security Council, a 15-member body charged with maintaining global security.The five permanent members at the core of the Security Council, including China and Russia, wield veto powers.Opponents of the resolution -- including China, Russia and Cuba -- said the measure was politically manipulated and would set a precedent for other nations to be targeted in the future.A North Korea representative told the U.N. gathering Tuesday that the resolution "provoked confrontation" and "failed to reflect the reality on the ground."China is likely to use its veto as its officials have repeatedly said efforts to send North Korea's leadership to the ICC "won't help improve a country's human rights condition." North Korea's longtime ally has never wavered in its support for Pyongyang.North Korea's leaders have been accused of employing murder, torture, slavery, sexual violence and mass starvation to prop up the isolated regime and exercise total control over its citizens.North Korea has repeatedly denied the existence of political camps or human rights abuses in the country.North Korea: 'We were forced to eat grass and soil'The country has accused the United States and its allies of seeking to discredit and overthrow the leadership in North Korea.In May, Russia and China vetoed a U.N. Security Council resolution that would have asked the International Criminal Court to investigate war crimes in Syria. They were the only two of 15 countries to vote against the resolution.The U.S. backs the resolution to sanction and refer North Korea to the ICC.Opinion: Stop romancing North KoreaNorth Korea last week released the last remaining Americans -- Kenneth Bae and Matthew Todd Miller -- detained in the country, but the gesture has not altered the United State's stance on the country's human rights record.In February, the United Nations Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in North Korea published a 400-page report documenting widespread torture and abuse, and called for urgent action, including the referral of its findings to the ICC for possible prosecution.Kim Jong Il's former bodyguard tells of beatings, starvation in prison campThe almost yearlong investigation by the commission involved more than 320 witnesses in public hearings and private interviews. It listed a litany of abuses including a new mother being forced to drown her newborn, corpses being eaten by dogs and rampant beatings.North Korea's ambassador to the United Nations, So Se Pyong, said the United States and "other hostile forces" had fabricated the report in an attempt to "defame the dignified image of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and eventually eliminate its social system."Before Tuesday's vote, an amendment proposed by Cuba to delete the language about an ICC referral was rejected 77-40, with 50 abstentions.Cuban Ambassador Rodolfo Reyes Rodriguez said U.N. resolutions targeting North Korea or any other single country were a "tool to attack others."Opinion: Moment of truth for North Korea over human rights</content>

        <content>Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- The physical wounds are clear.Dozens of purple scars crisscross Lee Young-guk's lower legs. He says many are the result of beatings endured while imprisoned in North Korea's most notorious prison camp.Removing his dentures, Lee shows just five or six original teeth, wonky and cracked; the only ones he has left after countless punches to the head. Being hit with the butt of a rifle, he says, left him blind in one eye.Lee was the bodyguard to Kim Jong Il for more than 10 years, before the late North Korean leader assumed power in 1994.A once loyal servant of the regime, Lee says he left Kim's employment without issues. He realized he was not a nice man, but only after he traveled out of North Korea, and saw how other parts of the world functioned, did it become clear to him that Kim was a dictator.READ: "I was born in a prison camp"Walking skeletonsLee tried to escape but was captured while trying to defect to South Korea and thrown into the infamously brutal Yodok political camp."If you are a political prisoner, Yodok's main goal is to kill you," he says. He remembers when he first arrived seeing inmates who looked like walking skeletons."It was tough enough that they barely fed me," he says. "What was worse was they kept on beating me, and they executed people once a week, which we were forced to watch. You have to be mentally strong, then the cycle repeats itself."In the five years between being arrested in China and his release for good behavior, Lee says he lost almost half his body weight.He says inmates were so weak from the lack of food, they were rarely able to life their heads unless ordered to do so by guards. If they were unable to complete their physical work for the day, Lee says they weren't fed."Then you will get hungry and your stomach will get very big, and your legs and face will turn to skeleton-like figure. But they won't feed us. Then I will die."Lee tells me of the flower garden at Yodok, a euphemistic phrase used by defectors to describe mass graves at the camps."Yodok's flower garden has thousands, even tens of thousands of people in it. Lines and lines of dead bodies. I had to carry them, bodies with fluids still flowing out of them and bury them where the guards told us."OPINION: Stop romancing North KoreaU.N. resolutionThis week, members of the United Nations' third committee are expected to vote on a draft resolution, submitted by Europe and Japan, to refer North Korea to the International Criminal Court (ICC) for crimes against humanity.If it passes, it will be put to a vote by the General Assembly in December.North Korea has repeatedly denied the existence of political camps or human rights abuses in the country.Earlier this year, the government slammed a damning U.N. Commission of Inquiry into human rights in the country as an attempt to undermine the government.Kim Song, adviser for political affairs at the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's mission to the United Nations, called the report's accusations of human rights abuses "groundless," and said those who escaped to tell their stories were "human scum."North Korea concessionsDespite rejecting the report, North Korea has made a number of recent concessions, including the unexpected release of three American prisoners.READ: CIA Director details North Korea missionBut U.N. officials say they are a transparent attempt to mitigate the report's effects and avert international action.Lee is adamant North Korean leaders must be held accountable from crimes committed against its own people.He says he met the current leader Kim Jong Un a number of times while protecting his father, when the young Kim was just a boy of six or seven years old.Now Kim is in charge, Lee wants to see him punished for these camps and his crimes."You need to refer Kim Jong Un to ICC, that's how places like Yodok can disappear," he says."I still have a lot of resentment."</content>
