        <content>Vienna, Austria (CNN) -- Days ahead of a deadline to strike a deal, Iran's foreign minister engaged Friday in what Britain's top diplomat deemed "complex" but "useful discussions" on Tehran's controversial nuclear program that -- despite positive vibes on both sides -- have yet to produce a breakthrough."There are still significant gaps," British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said from Vienna. "... We are going away for technical discussions."One person who wasn't going away -- or at least leaving Vienna -- was Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif.Zarif met for a second time in recent days with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and the European Union's foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton. His next meetings were with Hammond and French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius.The Iranian minister once planned to return to Tehran on Friday night to consult with leaders there. But a member of his delegation said that, for the moment, the Iranian minister had no plans to leave Austria.There's a lot at stake ahead of a November 24 deadline for the U.S. and five other world powers to reach an agreement with Iran over the Middle Eastern nation's nuclear program.Iran and the group known as the P5+1 -- consisting of Germany, the United States, Russia, China, France and Britain, the latter five being permanent members of the U.N. Security Council -- agreed last February on a framework for comprehensive negotiations over Tehran's nuclear program.P5+1 and Iran agree on nuclear negotiation frameworkIn July, they agreed to a four-month extension of those negotiations -- another positive step, but still anything but a long-term agreement to put the issue to rest.A deal could mean an end to significant sanctions against Tehran and an opening up of the country to the West, a transition that would have begun with the June 2013 election of Hassan Rouhani as Iran's president. The lack of a deal could further inflame tensions and could lead to more punitive measures -- perhaps more sanctions or even military strikes or a confrontation of some sort.Iran has insisted that like other countries, it has a right to develop nuclear power. Western powers have accused Iran of not being forthright enough and trying to develop not just nuclear power, but nuclear weapons as well.To this point, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, who is not part of Vienna talks, said Thursday that Iranian authorities are continuing to deny his agency access to a sensitive military complex suspected of being a site of nuclear activities."Iran has not provided any explanations that enable the Agency to clarify the outstanding practical measures, nor has it proposed any new practical measures in the next step of the Framework for Cooperation, despite several requests from the Agency," Yukiya Amano said from Austria.Kerry, America's top diplomat, talked by phone with Sergey Lavrov, his Russian counterpart, about the Iran negotiations, Russia's Foreign Ministry said.He had been scheduled to leave Vienna on Friday night but delayed his exit until at least Saturday "in order to continue consultations" with Zarif, Ashton and others, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said.The same day, U.S. President Barack Obama made an announcement that seems to signal that, at the least, Washington hasn't given up hope on a deal by announcing a "pause (to) efforts to further further reduce Iran's crude oil sales during the" ongoing talks."In return for this and other limited relief measures, Iran has taken steps that have halted -- and in key respects rolled back -- progress on its nuclear program," the White House said in a statement. "The International Atomic Energy Agency has verified that Iran is meeting these commitments."As to the talks, Hammond in a statement described them as "positive discussions" conducted in "a very cordial atmosphere.""It is clear that both sides want to try to get a deal done but none of us want a bad deal, and we are very clear that we have to get more flexibility from the Iranians," he said. "In return, we are prepared to show some flexibility on our side. But time is short."Ali Larijani, the head of Iran's parliament, sounded an optimistic note in remarks reported by IRNA. He said that when you look at the talks as a whole, there are grounds for a deal."As far as I'm informed, the two sides have had serious talks," he said.CNN's Nic Robertson reported from Vienna, and CNN's Greg Botelho reported and wrote from Atlanta.

        <content>Jerusalem (CNN) -- The Israeli military said Friday it arrested three Palestinians from the West Bank and charged them in an alleged plot to assassinate Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman.Court documents say the scheme involved a plan to purchase rocket-propelled grenades and fire them on his convoy. Lieberman has a home in a West Bank settlement.The military suspects that the three men gathered intelligence on Lieberman's convoy.The indictment sheet says the plot was hatched in August during Operation Protective Edge -- an Israeli military assault against the Hamas military wing in Gaza, designed to stop Palestinian rocket attacks into Israel.A Hamas spokesman said he was unaware of a planned attack, but he justified it.All Israeli leaders are legitimate targets because Israeli soldiers killed Palestinian children and women, and they entered Al Aqsa mosque and attacked Palestinians, said Sami Abu Zuhri.The military and police said they also uncovered an intended gun and car attack on the Jewish West Bank settlement of Gush Etzion.Three Israeli teenagers were kidnapped there in June, contributing to tensions in the lead-up to the military action in Gaza.CNN's Amir Tal reported from Jerusalem; Ben Brumfield wrote and reported from Atlanta.</content>

        <content>Jerusalem (CNN) -- A Palestinian man has admitted to deliberately ramming a vehicle into three Israeli soldiers in the West Bank two weeks ago -- one of several recent cases of violence in the Palestinian territory or Jerusalem -- Israeli police said Thursday.Jamal Hamam Mesalmeh, 23, turned himself in to Israeli authorities shortly after the November 5 incident near the village of al-Aroub and claimed it was an accident, police said. The soldiers suffered moderate injuries, officials said at the time.Israeli police said Mesalmeh is an activist associated with the Islamist Hamas movement. Police said he claimed he was inspired in part by an attack in eastern Jerusalem earlier November 5 -- one in which Israeli authorities said a Palestinian drove into pedestrians at a rail station, killing two Israelis and at least 12 other people before police shot and killed the driver.Tensions between Israelis and Palestinians have worsened in recent months, agitated in part by arguments over the Jerusalem holy site called the Temple Mount by Jews and Haram al-Sharif, or the Noble Sanctuary, by Muslims.Those incidents include Tuesday's attack on a Jerusalem synagogue, where Israeli authorities say two Palestinian cousins wielding a gun killed four worshipers and a police officer before the assailants themselves were killed. It was the deadliest attack in Jerusalem since 2008.Hamas did not claim responsibility for Tuesday's killings, but a spokesman for the group linked it to the discovery Sunday of a Palestinian bus driver hanged in his bus not far from the synagogue. Israeli authorities say the bus driver's death was a suicide, but his family disputes that, claiming he was attacked.The violence followed other hit-and-run incidents last month.On October 22, a Palestinian man rammed his car into commuters waiting at a light-rail stop in Jerusalem, killing a baby and wounding several other people Israeli police said. Three days earlier, a 5-year-old girl died after an Israeli settler deliberately ran her over as she returned him from kindergarten in the West Bank, Palestinian state news reported.CNN's Kareem Khadder reported from Jerusalem.

        <content>Jerusalem (CNN) -- At the Jerusalem synagogue where two Palestinians carried out a bloody attack with butcher knives and a gun this week, worshipers are determined to keep praying.Four members of their congregation and a police officer were killed and several others wounded in the horrifying assault during morning prayers Tuesday, which left blood stains on sacred texts and prayer shawls."It's a huge shock that in a synagogue ... slaughterers come in with slaughter tools like butchers," said David Hershcovitz, a resident of Har Nof, the ultra-Orthodox Jerusalem neighborhood where the synagogue is situated.Despite the trauma, morning prayers resumed at the synagogue Wednesday."We don't feel revenge is something we need to do. We believe God runs the world, and God will do what he needs to do to take care of whoever did something," Hershcovitz said.But the attack has put people even more on edge in a city where tensions between Jews and Palestinians had already been running high.Who were the victims?Tensions over holy siteAuthorities say they have tightened security amid fears of further attacks or acts of revenge. On Wednesday, there were fewer cars and people than usual on the streets of Jerusalem, a typically bustling city.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded to the synagogue attack by ordering the demolition of the attackers' homes, as well as the acceleration of the destruction of homes of Palestinians who carried out earlier attacks.Early Wednesday, Israeli security forces demolished the home of the family of a Palestinian man who rammed his car into a crowd of people at a light rail station in Jerusalem last month.Religion has always been a key element of the conflict in the region, and the recent unrest has flared over the Jerusalem holy site known to Muslims as Haram al-Sharif and to Jews as the Temple Mount.It's sacred to both.But until recently, violent attacks on places of worship had been relatively rare.In the past few weeks, two mosques have been set ablaze in arson attacks in the West Bank, leaving copies of the Quran, Islam's holy book, in ashes.'The tragedy'Residents of Har Nof, in western Jerusalem, are still shaken by Tuesday's attack.The four worshipers who were killed -- Avraham Shmuel Goldberg, 58; Aryeh Kupinsky, 43; Moshe Twersky, 59; and Kalman Levine, 55 -- were all rabbis who lived on the same street in the neighborhood, according to the Israeli Foreign Ministry.Goldberg was a dual British-Israeli citizen, and the other three were U.S.-Israeli citizens.Local media reports said one of the attackers worked at a store in the area. Freshly plastered signs on one wall read, "Jews Employ Jews."Shimon Shor runs a grocery store close to the synagogue.He said the attackers didn't work at his store, but three of the victims shopped there.On the day of the attack, the young son of one of the dead men walked in just hours after the killings."You couldn't see in him any sign," Shor said. "He didn't grasp it. You could see that he didn't grasp what happened to him -- the tragedy."Shor said he let the boy pick his favorite candy and urged him to go home, the only solace he could offer.Zidan Saif, a police officer, died from wounds he suffered while trying to stop the synagogue attackers, authorities say.Saif was Druze. The Druze are an Arabic-speaking religious community, a monotheistic offshoot of Islam that also combines elements of other religions. Of its members in Israel, many live in Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.On Wednesday, Israeli President Reuven Rivlin spoke at Saif's funeral which was attended by thousands, including people from the ultra-Orthodox community."Your dear Zidan stood fearlessly before the terrorists," Rivlin said, "and used his own body to block their attack, to block their fire."CNN's Atika Shubert reported from Jerusalem, and Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong.

        <content>(CNN) -- A college trip to Israel changed rabbi Kalman Levine's life, his childhood best friend Shimon Kraft remembers.They grew up in Kansas City, Missouri. Levine was always whip smart, funny and kind. He became a giving husband, a wise dad to nine children and a doting grandfather to five, his friend said.Kalman was a dental student at University of Southern California when the two went to Israel. Levine loved it so much he stayed and devoted his life to studying Jewish text."To be killed in such a cruel way when all he cared about was kindness ..." Kraft said, his voice trailing off. "I know he's in a great place. His priority in life was connecting to God."Levine's friends and family cling to that optimism in the wake of his slaying, along with three others rabbis, on Tuesday at the ultra-Orthodox Jerusalem neighborhood of Har Nof.At 7 a.m. local time, officials say that two Palestinian cousins from East Jerusalem, armed with a gun and butcher knives, came charging into the synagogue and slaughtered 55-year-old Levine, Moshe Twersky, 59; Aryeh Kupinsky, 43 and Avraham Shmuel Goldberg, 68.Levine, Kupinsky and Twerksy had dual U.S.-Israeli citizenship, according to the Jerusalem Post. Goldberg was a British-Israeli national, authorities said, and reportedly grew up in Liverpool.While police tried to apprehend the attackers, at least eight people were wounded. Among them was 30-year-old Israel police officer Zidan Saif, who was Druze.The Druze are an Arabic-speaking religious community, a monotheistic offshoot of Islam that also combines elements of other religions. Many of its members live in Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.Saif died hours later Tuesday. Thousands, including those from the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community, attended his funeral Wednesday, Haaretz reported.The terror attack left behind more than a gut-wrenching scene. Police released photos of the synagogue's floor covered in blood and prayer books and prayer shawls covered in red. It has inflamed already strained relations between Palestinians and Jews and put the city of Jerusalem on edge.The brutality at the synagogue was the deadliest attack in Jerusalem since 2008 when a man with an automatic weapon and handgun killed eight seminary students. A series of stabbings and vehicles attacks has recently beset the city.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the attack "the direct result of incitement being led by Hamas" and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, referring first to the Palestinian group that controls Gaza and next to the Fatah movement leader in control of the West Bank.Abbas reportedly condemned the attack and stressed the importance of ending the sometimes root of such violence, including tensions over what Jews call the Temple Mount and Palestinians call al-Aqsa Mosque.Ma'an, a semi-official Palestinian news agency, identified the attackers as Ghassan Abu Jamal and his cousin Udayy.It's unclear whether their alleged actions were part of a coordinated campaign or spontaneous.A 'gigantic soul'A world away, in Los Angeles, Shimon Kraft focused on remembering his friend. "He had an amazingly gigantic soul," he told CNN. "He didn't waste a minute. He was so alive."Levine had been living in Israel for years, Kraft said.Alan Edelman, the executive director of the Jewish Federation of Greater Kansas City, said Levine moved to Israel 30 years ago."He was always a sweet, wonderful person," Edelman told CNN. "He was really someone who tried to bring people together no matter what their background was, and their approach to life or religion. Such a tragic irony that a person who loved his fellow human beings would meet a tragic end in such a horrible attack."Dedicated to faithMoshe Twersky immigrated to Israel in 1990, The New York Times reported.Twersky is originally from Boston, according to the Jerusalem Post, and his father was Isadore Twersky. The elder Twersky was an internationally renowned rabbi and philosopher as well as a professor of Hebrew literature at Harvard University. When he died in 1997, the Harvard Crimson called him a pioneer of Jewish thought.Moshe Twersky's grandfather was Joseph B. Soloveitchik, who is considered a founding father of modern Orthodox philosophy.A New York Times obituary on Isadore Twersky says that Moshe Twersky had two brothers who were rabbis.Isadore Twersky formerly directed the Center for Jewish Studies at Harvard."I know that I speak for all of us in the CJS community when I say that we are heartbroken at the news of this unspeakable act of sacrilegious cruelty,'' Eric Nelson, the director of the center, told CNN. "Our thoughts and prayers are with the Twersky family at this terribly sad and difficult time."Moshe Twersky graduated from Boston's Maimonides School in 1973, the school said in a statement, adding that "the Maimonides School Family is engulfed in grief and outrage."Twerksy is survived by his wife, Bashy, their five children and many grandchildren.Kupinsky grew up in the Detroit suburb of Oak Park, the Detroit Free Press reported. The 43-year-old was a member of Young Israel of Oak Park, one of the largest Orthodox Jewish congregations in Michigan and moved to Israel with his family when he was in elementary school, a boyhood friend, Michael Zwick, told the newspaper."It was a terrible thing to hear," Zwick said of the slayings."He was so sweet, always smiling, always saying nice things," Kupinsky's friend Esther Schwartz told the newspaper. "We're shaken to the core. My husband and I couldn't stop crying this morning. We can't get it out of our heads, our minds. ... Such a useless, hateful thing they did killing him."Goldberg, who used to work as a chemical engineer, lived in Jerusalem with his wife and six children, his cousin Michelle Hirschfield told the Guardian.She is from London, and he left the British city more than 20 years ago."We are completely devastated," she told the newspaper. "He was just a tolerant, good man. ... I was due to see him in a couple of weeks when he was going to be in London.""This has brought it all home to us," she said. "This was a man who was simply praying in the morning at his usual synagogue, just going about his daily life, not trying to impose his views on anyone."'Wonderful men ... slaughtered'The devastation felt from the slayings was evident among mourners at an eulogy for the four rabbis."When four great men, wonderful men, wise in Torah study are slaughtered while praying in public, there is no public grieving greater than that," the man at a microphone said in Hebrew to the large crowd in the street.A camera captured young women wrapping their arms around each other and swaying. One buried her head in another's shoulder and wept."It was horrific," a man described as a witness to the slayings said in a Reuters video. "I can't imagine such attacks would occur to our community. We have to take some time to walk out of the trauma."The new President of Israel Reuven Rivlin attended officer Saif's funeral, as did members of the ultra-Orthodox community where the attack occurred, several news outlets reported.He has been vocal, Haaretz noted, about the need to better Jewish-Arab relations and to coexist in Israeli society. He praised Saif for his bravery and selflessness, the newspaper said."I stand before you in shock and in pain. ... Terror that does not differentiate between people, between creeds. ... Your beloved Zidan, one of this state's best sons, didn't hesitate and didn't waver," Rivlin said. "He was among the first to reach the scene of the massacre, among the first to protect the people of Jerusalem. Your dear Zidan stood fearlessly before the terrorists and used his own body to block their attack, to block their fire."The President addressed the mourners as another person wounded in the attack fought for his life. CNN partner network CTV said Canadian-Israeli dual citizen Howard Rothman, who was stabbed in his head, eyes and arms, was in a medically induced coma."He was trying to fight off the attackers," Toby Trumpter-Kraman, a family friend, told CTV.Obama condemns 'horrific' Jerusalem terror attackCNN's Michael Schwartz contributed to this story from Jerusalem and Greg Botelho contributed from Atlanta.

        <content>(CNN) -- An American imprisoned for nearly a month in the United Arab Emirates for taking photos has been released from custody and returning home to Georgia, a family spokeswoman said.Robert Alan Black -- who'd been in the UAE to speak at an international creativity conference -- had been held in Abu Dhabi's Al Wathba prison since October 21 after being "charged with taking pictures of restricted areas," said Rosemary Rein, the spokeswoman for Friends of Alan Black.A former architect, Black often takes photos of buildings, according to Rein. Doing so is prohibited in some parts of the UAE, particularly in and around government buildings, embassies, military facilities and other places that are considered sensitive.He made a brief court appearance Monday, and was released the following day."The court found that the action was committed with no ill-intention, and ordered the minimum fine of 500 (UAE dirhams or about US $135)," according to Rein's statement, which was posted to a "Free Robert Alan Black" Facebook page.After his release, the 70-year-old headed to his home in Athens, Georgia."We're relieved and happy with this news," Rein said. "The international creativity community was concerned about our dear friend and colleague, and we're glad the matter has been resolved."Black characterizes himself as an architect, cartoonist, graphic designer, professor and creativity consultant on his website. He has given presentations at more more than 150 creativity conferences on six continents since 1978, and has written more than 600 articles and a book, "Broken Crayons: Break Your Crayons and Draw Outside the Lines."Rein has said Black's next stop, after the Abu Dhabi conference, was supposed to be Malaysia. But after noticing he hadn't posted to social media, she touched base with mutual acquaintances and learned that he'd never made it to Malaysia.</content>

        <content>(CNN) -- Four people were killed when a car bomb exploded near the Irbil provincial governor's office, Iraq's state-run Iraqiya TV reported Wednesday.Several other people were wounded in the blast in Irbil city, Iraqiya said.It was not immediately clear who the victims were or who was responsible. Kurdish security and government officials didn't answer CNN calls for comment.Irbil is the capital of Kurdistan's regional government, which is under the control of Kurdish and Peshmerga forces.The ISIS militant group has taken over small villages in Nineveh province, close to the Kurdistan region, but Irbil is still relatively safe.The explosion near the governor's office in the heart of the KRG capital is significant because the Kurdish region has had a history of stability, even during the sectarian battles between Sunnis and Shiites between 2005 and 2007.</content>

        <content>(CNN) -- The second annual edition of the Walk Free Foundation's Global Slavery Index has found that globally, almost 36 million people are subject to modern slavery.While incidences of slavery were found in every one of the 167 countries surveyed, five countries -- India, China, Pakistan, Uzbekistan and Russia -- accounted for nearly 22 million people (61%) suffering in bondage. The worst offender, India, accounted for an estimated 14.29 million people.Human slavery, the report states, is defined as "human trafficking, forced labor, debt bondage, forced or servile marriage, or commercial sexual exploitation."Surge in casesThe report found an increase of 20% on the foundation's findings a year ago, although it attributed the rise to more sophisticated data collection and analysis."There is an assumption that slavery is an issue from a bygone era. Or that it only exists in countries ravaged by war and poverty," Andrew Forrest, Chairman and Founder of the Walk Free Foundation, said in a statement."The first step in eradicating slavery is to measure it. And with that critical information, we must all come together -- governments, businesses and civil society -- to finally bring an end to the most severe form of exploitation."Highest percentagesWhile some of the world's most populous nations were home to the bulk of the incidences of modern slavery, other countries had higher percentages of their populations enslaved.The West African nation of Mauritania, the report found, had the highest prevalence, with an estimated 4% of its population in bondage. Other offenders include Uzbekistan (3.97%), Haiti (2.3%) and Qatar (1.35%).The Emirate, which will play host to the World Cup in 2022, has faced numerous questions concerning its labor laws and the kafala sponsorship system, which limits foreign workers' rights of movement."Qatar hosts significant numbers of foreign workers, and has risen in the ranking due to improved survey data, giving better insight into the high number of enslaved migrant workers in the nation," Gina Dafalia, the foundation's policy and research manager, told CNN. "It is ranked fourth with an estimated 1.4% of the population in modern slavery. We consider this to be a conservative estimate."Qatar has promised to address criticisms and expects to make announcements concerning repeal of the kafala system in early 2015.Refugees most vulnerable to slaveryKevin Bales, lead author of the report, told CNN's Kristie Lu Stout that vulnerability is a key factor in the prevalence of slavery in a country, and that refugees are particularly susceptible to modern enslavement."It's not a surprise that many of the countries where we see large proportions of the population in slavery are also those countries that are beset by conflict, like Syria, and by other economic and environmental problems," he said.The International Labor Organization (ILO) estimates that forced labor generates more than $150 billion in illicit profits every year, making it the second largest source of profits for international organized crimes behind the drugs trade.Bright spotsIceland and Luxembourg, the report finds, have fewer than 100 people each living in slavery, the lowest number both in prevalence and in absolute numbers.While it acknowledges the efforts made by some countries, such as the Netherlands, Sweden, the U.S. and Australia to tackle the global issue, the report also reprimands some rich countries for not doing more.Hong Kong, Singapore and Brunei, along with Qatar and Kuwait are singled out for mention.The Walk Free Foundation, a global human rights organization with a mission to end modern slavery in a generation, was founded by Australian philanthropists, Andrew and Nicola Forrest.</content>

        <content>Follow us at @WorldSportCNN and like us on Facebook(CNN) -- The bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups has taken a new twist as football's world governing body FIFA lodged a criminal complaint with the Swiss judiciary Tuesday.The complaint relates to the "international transfers of assets with connections to Switzerland, which merit examination by the criminal prosecution authorities."The FIFA statement added: "The subject of the criminal complaint is the possible misconduct of individual persons in connection with the awarding of the hosting rights of the 2018 and 2022 World Cup."FIFA lodged the complaint with the Attorney General of Switzerland in Berne on the recommendation of German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert -- FIFA's independent ethics adjudicator."I lodged the criminal complaint upon the recommendation of Judge Eckert," FIFA president Sepp Blatter said."I cannot, however, comment on any possible criminal offenses. I am not a lawyer."I also was not the addressee of the investigatory report, which I have never seen. However, given Judge Eckert's recommendation, it was my duty -- as the President of FIFA -- to lodge the complaint."Eckert's recommendation was based on the evidence compiled by Michael Garcia -- chairman of the investigatory chamber of the FIFA Ethics Committee -- who has been examining the awarding of the hosting rights of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.However Blatter insisted there was no change to Eckert's statement "that the investigation into the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups is concluded."Eckert, who is set to meet with Garcia on Thursday to discuss the report, says he came across "indications that pointed to suspected unlawful activity in connection with Switzerland."He told FIFA's website: "In the circumstances, I saw it as my duty to bring this to the FIFA President's attention and to recommend to him that the Swiss criminal prosecution authorities be informed."Eckert has been heavily criticized since publishing his 42-page summary into Garcia's 18-month investigation last Friday.The German told reporters last week that he had been surprised by the strength of bad feeling surrounding his summary."I would like to point out that not once did my statement involve a so-called "whitewashing" of the award process with regard to the various allegations and assumptions made, contrary to what has been claimed in some quarters," he said."My statement was based on the Garcia report -- I can only work with the material contained in it, and in my view, there was insufficient clear evidence of illegal or irregular conduct that would call into question the integrity of the award process as a whole."However, in certain places, the report does indicate that further clarification is needed of certain circumstances. Much of this clarification work can be carried out by the FIFA Ethics Committee itself, while the remainder is the responsibility of the relevant national investigatory authorities."With Garcia and Eckert set to discuss their differences over the summary on Thursday, Kevin Carpenter, who specializes in sports law for Kevin Hill Dickinson LLP, raised questions over the timing of the announcement."It's interesting that Garcia said his report had been misrepresented, yet Eckert decides to take evidence to the Swiss judiciary now," he told CNN."Why lodge the criminal complaint given they are meeting later this week?"Carpenter also believes that Garcia, who has appealed to FIFA's appeal committee over the findings in Eckert's summary, could take his complaints further."Michael Garcia has referred the matter to the appeals committee, but if his complaint is rejected he could then go to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which is extremely thorough and can look at all the evidence."CAS' decision and reasoning would be made public. Names would have to be redacted but it would be a way for the bulk of his report -- the sections he believes to be most important coming into the public domain."Read: Why women weren't good enough for World Cup reportRead: FIFA embroiled in civil war</content>
