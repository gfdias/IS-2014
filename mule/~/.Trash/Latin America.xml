        <author>By Shasta Darlington, CNN</author>
        <content>Read this story in Spanish at CNNMexico.comMexico City (CNN) -- Tens of thousands of protesters converged on Mexico City on Thursday to vent their frustration and anger over the disappearance of 43 college students, presumed by many to be dead, and widespread political corruption.Students, union workers and supporters from around the country streamed into the Mexican capital's main square, known as the Zocalo, for a demonstration that had been largely peaceful before ending in pitched battles between riot police and groups of protesters throwing rocks and Molotov cocktails.Before these clashes, protesters marched into the square chanting "Justice! Justice!" They carried banners and hand-made posters featuring pictures of the students who disappeared at the end of September.One group burned a giant doll resembling President Enrique Pena Nieto, who has come under fire for what some saw as his slow reaction to the students' disappearance and for traveling abroad as protests spread across the country.Others waved Mexican flags painted black to mourn the mostly poor, rural Mexicans who have disappeared or been killed in recent years amid the country's drug violence."The problem isn't just the 43 students, it's the thousands more that disappeared before them," said a vendor from the state of Mexico who traveled to the capital by bus to participate in the march. "We've ignored them for too long. We're not going to be quiet any longer."The students, mostly young men in their 20s who been taking classes to become teachers at a rural school in the southern state of Guerrero, on September 26 had taken buses and vans to nearby Iguala for a protest.Local police blocked the highway leading into the city and shot at the students' vehicles, killing at least one student.Officers took the remaining students away and, Mexican Attorney General Jes√∫s Murillo Karam has said, handed them over to a local criminal gang known as Guerreros Unidos. That gang not only had infiltrated the police department but was also complicit with Abarca, his wife and the now-former police chief, according to the attorney general.The gang burned the bodies and dumped them in a river, authorities say.But the students' families say they won't believe the account until there is proof and a thorough investigation. At Thursday's march, relatives led demonstrators in chanting, "They were taken away alive, we want them back alive!"In the days leading up to the protests, the families had traveled around Mexico in three caravans seeking support.The relatives also implored the backers to ensure the march was peaceful. When the protest showed signs of turning violent on Thursday night, they left.In fact, peaceful speeches and marches marked the event's first three-plus hours. But then a group of protesters -- with their faces covered -- clashed with police guarding the door to the National Palace that faces the Zocalo.Many demonstrators panicked and ran to get away from the violence, leading to a stampedes. Others retreated, chanting "Justice!" and slowly counting from one to 43.After a prolonged standoff with protesters throwing rocks and fireworks, hundreds of riot police swept across the Zocalo bearing shields and batons to clear out the area. Some of them used fire extinguishers against the protesters.Mounting fury over government officials' response to -- and possible role in -- the students' disappearance has convulsed the country for weeks, posing a growing challenge to Mexico's President amid demonstrations where at times violence has flared.CNN's Rosa Flores, Catherine E. Shoichet and Rey Rodriguez contributed to this report.</content>

        <date>2014-11-20T20:12:00.000Z</date>
        <author>By C. Stewart Verdery, Jr.</author>
        <content>Editor's note: C. Stewart Verdery, Jr. served as Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security from 2003-05 and is partner and founder of Monument Policy Group, a consulting firm which represents clients interested in immigration issues including FileRight, the U.S. Travel Association, and Microsoft. A full list of the firm's clients is available here. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.(CNN) -- The plan by President Obama to provide legal status to millions of undocumented adults living in the U.S. presents Congressional Republicans with a political quandary of the highest magnitude.Yet the President's decision to act unilaterally actually may provide Republicans with an opportunity to change the dynamic on immigration in a way that yields political benefit, not peril.While the contours of the President's plan won't be known until Thursday evening, timely leaks indicate that two major new policies will be announced. First, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security will change its policies for detaining and deporting undocumented individuals so that parents of children with legal status in the U.S. cannot be deported absent committing additional crimes, and will expand the population eligible for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program which also allows individuals to remain in the U.S. Second, these people will be allowed to apply for work permits to continue or obtain legal employment in the U.S.The media coverage of these policies has conflated the two policies but they involve very different executive branch authorities and political sensitivities.Choosing not to initiate law enforcement action against certain groups of people is a decision that falls squarely within the executive branch's prosecutorial discretion.It is probably true that no prior administration would have ever dared to ignore the law to this magnitude and after Congress failed to enact legislation to legalize this large a population.Nonetheless, this decision is not only likely to be upheld in court if challenged, it is also very hard to overturn by legislation because the very nature of immigration enforcement means choices must be made on what types of cases to pursue.Providing work permits, however, is an affirmative benefit that falls on much shakier legal and political grounds, especially with economic concerns still front and center with American voters.Immigration-reform legislation has been stalled for a decade because neither those most concerned about legalization of the undocumented nor those most concerned about interior enforcement have had enough votes in Congress to pass a one-sided bill and neither side was willing to accept a compromise that included both. Major attempts to tie all of these threads together in a massive bill fell short of final passage in 2006, 2007 and 2013.A major enforcement-only bill passed the House in 2005 but died in the Senate. Without resolution of the legalization and interior enforcement issues, other aspects of immigration reform where there is much more consensus -- such as broader low-skilled guest worker programs, efforts to encourage high-skilled immigration, tourism expansion measures, and mandatory employment verification -- have been held hostage to those more divisive questions.Meanwhile the politics on immigration has hurt Republican efforts to claim the White House in 2008 and 2012. Surely the issue looms as an even larger albatross for the party in 2016.The President's decision to detach the legalization issue is the political lifeline Republicans need. Republicans could include a rider in a must-pass appropriations bill that denies funding to provide work permits to the undocumented and forbids implementation of any initiative that diverts funding away from processing of legal immigration applications from those who have played by the rules.Such a rider would not block changes to deportation policy nor the ability of the White House to set up a fee-based program to allow the undocumented to obtain temporary legal status short of citizenship.The bill should also incorporate the additional border security spending included in the 2013 Senate bill which supporters claimed was necessary at the time to block new waves of undocumented migration.Congressional Democrats would be hard-pressed to block this type of bill, and the President would be faced with a very difficult veto decision when the bill arrived at his desk.Even if Republicans eventually were forced to drop the work permit rider to keep the government operating, at least the debate would have been shifted to their advantage by focusing on the economy and employment instead of an abstract argument about where to prioritize deportations.Separately, when the new Congress arrives in January, the House should take up pieces of legislation that would implement the other facets of immigration reform that are necessary to build an enforceable system for the future.Last year, the House developed an important set of bills to improve border security, implement an agricultural guest worker program, mandate employee verification, and expand high-skilled immigration programs. So long as none of these bills provides legal support for the President's legalization program, House Republicans could pass the rest of immigration reform that would help American businesses and deter future flows of undocumented labor.Incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, has indicated a desire to move these types of measures individually, and it seems unlikely that Senate Democrats have enough leverage to block these popular measures if they do not overturn the legalization done by fiat. And it seems unlikely that the President could insist on an even broader legalization as the price for signing these types of bills.If successful, Republicans could claim credit for building a 21st century immigration system, avoid the political pitfalls of advocating mass deportations, and escape the immigration dilemma without having to offer citizenship to those legalized by the President. Isn't this a better political outcome than an unsuccessful showdown over the President's deportation priorities?Obviously the politics of immigration remain a high wire act that is continually shifting. A terrorist incident, a cross border disease outbreak, economic downturns, or problems with vetting and enrollment of the undocumented, could turn the politics of immigration to the Republicans' advantage. But the alternative scenario is perhaps more likely: once millions of undocumented individuals have passed a background check, how much support will exist to deport them?As has often been said, most Americans support immigration enforcement in general, just not against the specific undocumented individuals they actually know who have families in their neighborhoods, or work at local factories, childcare centers, or hospitals.Perhaps this view is why polling in 2014 shows a majority of Americans support a path to legal status for most undocumented aliens as opposed to a focus on deportation.And it is only the very rare hardliner that wants to pay for a government large enough to deport 12 million people.Republicans need to look beyond the politics of the moment and ask themselves, what is best long-term outcome for immigration policy?Passing pro-business, pro-market, pro-enforcement measures and allowing the President to own the legalization piece is about the best outcome Republicans can expect.The President's decision is a trail out of the immigration box canyon Republicans currently face -- will they be clever enough to take it?Read CNNOpinion's new Flipboard magazineFollow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.</content>

        <content>(CNN) -- A Honduran beauty queen and her sister were found dead Wednesday, police said, and the sister's boyfriend and another man have been arrested.The bodies of Mar√≠a Jos√© Alvarado Mu√±oz, the reigning Miss World Honduras, and her sister, Sofia Trinidad Alvarado, were found buried in a shallow grave in a mountainous area beside a river, Honduran authorities told CNN affiliate Televicentro.The bodies of the sisters, who had been missing for several days, were found on top of each other, Santa Barbara Mayor Juan Alvarado told the outlet.Plutarco Antonio Ruiz Rodriguez and Aris Valentin Maldonado Mejia are now in police custody, and investigators believe more people are involved in the sisters' deaths, Police Deputy Commissioner Rolando Casco Torres told Televicentro.Ruiz was Sofia's boyfriend, police say, according to CNN en Espa√±ol.The sisters disappeared Thursday night after going to a spa for a birthday party for Ruiz in Santa Barbara, northwest of the capital of Tegucigalpa, police told CNN en Espa√±ol.Ruiz is suspected of killing the two sisters, said Leandro Osorio, chief of the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation.Ruiz also "is considered the person who was most in contact" with the victims, Casco added, according to Televicentro.Edgardo Casana, a congressman from Santa Barbara, said the two women, their other sister and Ruiz were all students of his when they were younger. In fact, Casana, a teacher, said he knew the three sisters' family well, and that Ruiz was also in a youth soccer league with Casana's children, he said."I'm dismayed by what happened," Casana told the CNN affiliate.As a boy in Casana's class and in the soccer league, Ruiz was temperamental but also quiet, humble and gentle, Casana said. Ruiz's nickname was Paco, the official said.In fact, Casana just saw Ruiz on Monday in Santa Barbara, the congressman said."We talked about soccer," Casana said.Alvarado, 19, was supposed to leave for London soon to participate in the Miss World pageant, police said.Their family reported the women's disappearance on Saturday. Their mother, Teresa Mu√±oz, initially believed her two daughters were kidnapped.Eduardo Zablah, director of the pageant in Honduras, told Televicentro that Alvarado and her sister were last seen getting into a vehicle after attending a party last week.The young woman was to be among the contestants from more than 120 countries who arrive in London this week for early rounds of the Miss World pageant. The final round is scheduled for December 14.A student from Santa Barbara, Honduras, Alvarado beat 18 contestants to win the Miss World Honduras crown in April.In her profile on the pageant's website, she described herself as "dedicated" and said she would someday like to go into government, specifically as a diplomat for her country.She also said that she liked playing volleyball and soccer, eating Honduran food and performing the country's traditional punta dance.Julia Morley, the chairman of the Miss World pageant, said contestants will hold a special service Sunday to honor Alvarado and her sister and offer prayers for their families."We are devastated by this terrible loss of two young women, who were so full of life," Morley said.Honduras has the world's highest murder rate, the United Nations reported earlier this year, with 90.4 homicides per 100,000 people in 2012.Journalist Elvin Sandoval, reporting from Tegucigalpa, Honduras, and CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet and Greg Botelho in Atlanta contributed to this report.</content>

        <content>Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Why was a Colombian army general traveling deep in rebel territory, out of uniform and without bodyguards?That country's largest guerrilla group Tuesday confirmed capturing Gen. Rub√©n Dar√≠o Alzate. The announcement came during a news conference in Havana, where guerrillas and Colombian government officials have been holding peace talks.Both Colombian government officials and rebel leaders said they did not know what Alzate was doing in a remote area of western Colombia when guerrillas captured him over the weekend.Colombian media reported he was the highest-ranking officer to be taken prisoner during the country's blood, five-decades-old civil war.Alzate commands a 2,500-soldier counterinsurgency group and previously headed the army's anti-kidnapping unit.Leaders of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known as FARC, said they gained a valuable prize by taking Alzate prisoner."We are talking about a general who is one of the most important generals to their concept of counter-insurgency," the FARC leader known as Pablo Catatumbo said at the news conference Tuesday.On Monday, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos suspended the peace talks and demanded that FARC release Alzate immediately. Santos also called on the country's military to investigate why Alzate had apparently broken protocol by venturing into rebel territory.According to Colombian government officials, Alzate was traveling by a boat along a river in an area known to be a hub for drug smugglers and rebels when he, an Army lawyer and a corporal were captured. A second soldier traveling with the group managed to escape and told officials that Alzate and his companions had been in the area to inspect an energy project.But on Tuesday, FARC leaders said no such project exists in that area and that they were also baffled what Alzate's presence there. FARC leaders would not say whether they would free Alzate so that the peace talks could continue."We are willing to find a prompt, calm and just solution to this problem," said Catatumbo.The U.S. government has provided Colombia's military with billions of dollars in training and aid to battle FARC guerrillas, who authorities accuse of massive-scale drug trafficking to finance their insurgency.At the beginning of the peace talks in 2012, FARC leaders said they had released all their prisoners and hostages as a sign of good faith. But President Santos has resisted their offers of a ceasefire, saying a previous armistice allowed rebels to seize large swathes of territory.</content>

        <author>By Michael Martinez and Jaqueline Hurtado, CNN and CNN en Espanol</author>
        <content>San Jose, California (CNN) -- In parental torment over what became of his son and 42 other missing Mexican students, Isrrael Galindo rejects official accounts they apparently were massacred. He hopes that somehow his son and the others are still alive."I think they have him arrested or locked up. I don't know where he is, but if I knew, I would go get him," Galindo said of Israel, 19, his namesake son with a different spelling."I want him to know that I love him," he added, beginning to weep. "I want him alive."Anguish overwhelms Galindo and grows daily, ever since the aspiring primary school teachers disappeared September 26 in a violent clash with police during a political protest that also left six people dead, including three other students.The mass disappearance is so haunting that Galindo can't believe it befell his son. The father hasn't seen Israel in eight years, since migrating to California to find work and send money to his wife and their four sons back in Mexico, but the memory of him burns vividly.The 43 missing students went missing after they had been captured by police in the city of Iguala, in Guerrero state. They allegedly were turned over to a gang in cartel territory and then executed in a dumpster in Cocula, 14 miles away. The gang burned the bodies and dumped them in a river, authorities say.Fighting a "monster"Like many other parents and their supporters, Galindo excoriates Mexican officials in the same breath that he asserts his son is alive."I don't lose faith, but we have fought and fought this monster in front of us, and we can't get ahead," said Galindo, 66, a handyman who lives in San Jose and is believed to be the only U.S.-based parent of any of the 43 students.The "monster" is the Mexican government, Galindo says. He doesn't believe what authorities say about the students having been tortured and killed. The story is a way for Mexican authorities to push the case aside and move on, he says. The 43 students were mostly men in their 20s from a college outside Iguala devoted to helping poor, rural schools.So far, authorities have charged Iguala Mayor Jose Luis Abarca as the "probable mastermind" in the 43 students' disappearance, and he has been charged with six counts of aggravated homicide and one count of attempted homicide, authorities said.In all, at least 74 people have been arrested in connection with the disappearances and the deaths, and the governor of Guerrero has taken a leave of absence amid scorching criticism that he responded too slowly to what's been called one of the most serious human rights abuses in recent Latin American history.Galindo isn't satisfied with those arrests."I can't tell you that our government isn't doing anything. They say one thing and then promise another. They say they are going to do something, and they deviate and they don't do anything," Galindo said.Uproar at highest placesThe inability of authorities to locate the 43 students or their bodies is an open wound on the psyche of the 43 families and Mexican society. The case is being compared by human rights activists to Mexico City's Tlatelolco Square massacre on the eve of the 1968 Olympics there, in which police are alleged to have killed as many as 300 student demonstrators calling for greater democracy in what was then a one-party system.The current public uproar has touched the highest political and religious institutions in Mexico.At the holiest of shrines devoted to Mexico's patron saint, some parents prayed to the Virgin at the Basilica of Guadalupe in Mexico City, chanting "alive they were taken, alive we want them returned.""We have come here so that the Virgin will give us a miracle, to give us a hand, so that my son and the others will appear," Clemente Rodriguez Moreno, father of missing Christian, told AFP at the Basilica in October.Then, demonstrators spray-painted and tried to burn a door to the Palacio Nacional, or National Palace, in Mexico City's central square in unsuccessful effort to breach it.On November 20, a national caravan of protesters will converge on Mexico City, led by some of the families of the missing 43 people and other students from la Escuela Normal Rural de Ayotzinapa, a small college devoted to training students to become teachers.Parents' demandsThe parents even met with President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto in his Los Pinos residence about the police search for the missing 43 people and declared the government's results insufficient."As parents, as students, as lawyers, we believe that these commitments are not enough," said Meliton Ortega, father of missing Mauricio. "There are no results for us. The results for us will be significant the moment that they hand over all of our missing children."The parents want a team of Argentina specialists to review the investigation, and they want the Mexican President to sign an agreement with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights to participate in the probe, according to the parents' attorney, Vidulfo Rosales."Today there is no irrefutable proof, there remains lines of investigations, there are several people who need to be arrested, there are several statements that could change the course of the investigation," Rosales said."Parents are not going to accept the hypothesis before us. It is not a conclusive, final investigation. The investigation needs to be open, so that there will be the full truth that the parents are fighting for. We make several petitions that we find this truth," Rosales said.Other missing people casesThe alleged massacre of the 43 students has now prompted other families to renew attention on long unsolved cases of missing relatives and migrants in Mexico.Mexico's Interior Ministry counts 22,322 missing people since 2006, excluding the 43 students. The country's National Institute of Migration says 3,000 migrants from Central America have also gone missing in Mexico since 2010.Mercedes Moreno has been wondering for 23 years what became of her son when he traveled from his native El Salvador to Mexico in attempt to reach the United States."Twenty-three years that I haven't been to give him a hug on his birthday, 23 years that I haven't been able to my son Merry Christmas," Moreno said of her son, Jose, who would now be age 47.She criticized the Mexican government for failing to solve the case. She gave a DNA sample of her son to authorities a decade ago."It doesn't matter what country we're in, what nationality we are, pain is pain," said Moreno, a retiree who lives in an Los Angeles apartment filled with photos of her missing son.Backlash against teachers' collegeIn San Jose, Galindo resides in a modest house owned by his wife's family in the working class Tropicana neighborhood. An extended family lives in the one-story residence, with cousins and a grandmother.Galindo's last contact with his son was a phone call just eight days before he and other students traveled in buses to Iguala to protest a speech by the mayor's wife, Maria de los Angeles Pineda, who along with her husband are known as "the imperial couple."A history of antagonism exists between Iguala's elite and the students of Ayotzinapa, who were involved in a violent protest last year.The students are portrayed by Iguala's business and political leaders as rabble-rousers, one Mexican analyst said."The young students who are studying to be teachers of farmers have been stigmatized. They have been presented as vandals, people who cause problems," Luis Hernandez Navarro, editor of La Jornada, one of Mexico's major newspapers, told CNN en Espanol.The rural teachers' colleges, sometimes called normal schools, are called "devil schools" by critics, Hernandez said."These are schools that are poor, and for the poor, to teach the poor," Hernandez said. The schools have been in the government's cross hairs, and business groups have requested they be closed, he added."These schools are the gateway to move socially for the poor, rural students," Hernandez said, "and they are one of the few escape routes that farmers have for their children to become teachers and prosper."A father's prideWhatever antipathy existed against the students, nothing could excuse this, Hernandez said."They did this because they knew they could," Hernandez said, "and they don't think there will be consequences."But Galindo is proud that all four of his sons attended the teachers college, located in Tixtla, about 77 miles south of Iguala."Two of them are already teachers, and they graduated from Ayotzinapa. My other son was in his second year in Ayotzinapa," Galindo said.He said he wants more than justice for his son."I need to see him."</content>

        <author>By Sally Kohn, CNN Political Commentator</author>
        <content>Editor's note: Sally Kohn is an activist, columnist and television commentator. Follow her on Twitter: @sallykohn. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.(CNN) -- Whether or not we reform our nation's immigration laws may all come down to cantaloupes versus cojones.Last year, Iowa Republican Congressman Steve King attacked undocumented immigrant children in America, saying, "for every one who is a valedictorian, there's another 100 out there that weigh 130 pounds and they have calves the size of cantaloupes because they're hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert."Colorful though it might have been, that characterization is not only insulting but completely incorrect. Still, it reflects the underlying sentiment of many Americans who oppose immigration reform not just on rational grounds, but based on a deeper, emotional bias.Then you have everyone else ‚Äî in fact, the strong majority of Americans ‚Äî who support comprehensive immigration reform, including a workable path to citizenship. This crowd certainly includes President Obama and Democrats, who have reiterated that passing immigration reform is one of their key legislative priorities. And it presumably includes leaders in the Republican Party, who want to curry favor with business interests and Latino voters who support fixing our nation's broken immigration system. So the question is: Do Republicans have the cojones to ignore the "cantaloupe caucus" and do the right thing?As a refresher, here's where things stood before the election: In 2013, the Democratic-controlled Senate passed bipartisan legislation that would create a workable path to citizenship for America's undocumented immigrants while at the same time ensuring our immigration system and borders works as they're supposed to for the future. Although Republicans controlled the House of Representatives, the measure reportedly had enough support from individual Republicans, as well as Democrats, to pass. But House Speaker John Boehner wouldn't allow the measure to come up for a vote. And so it stalled.In the wake of Republicans failing to take leadership, President Obama said he would consider executive action to do what he could on his own, under his constitutional authority, to provide relief to millions of undocumented immigrants. The President held off such action before the election. Now, if Republicans again fail to act, executive action is back on the table.At a press conference following this year's midterm elections, President Obama said: "I feel obliged to do everything I can lawfully with my executive authority to make sure that we don't keep on making the system worse, but that whatever executive actions that I take will be replaced and supplanted by action by Congress. You send me a bill that I can sign, and those executive actions go away."If Congress won't show leadership, the President will. In other words, the ball is in Republicans' court.We should take a moment to remember that in 2005, it was Republicans who championed immigration reform. Republican Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham were instrumental in co-sponsoring and advocating for immigration reform and such efforts were enthusiastically backed by President George W. Bush.By the same token, in 2013, four Senate Republicans ‚Äî John McCain, Lindsey Graham, Jeff Flake and Marco Rubio ‚Äî joined four Senate Democrats to craft and pass the currently immigration reform bill.Rubio eventually explicitly opposed his own bill ‚Äî and last week, Rubio, McCain and Graham sent a letter to President Obama implicitly criticizing the bill suggesting there should be no path to citizenship until border security demands are met (whereas the pending legislation addresses both simultaneously). Meanwhile, Republicans have used border security as a constantly-retreating goalpost to stall meaningful immigration reform.If President Obama uses his constitutional authority to take limited action on immigration relief, it will not be without legal or political precedent. In 2012, President Obama directed his administration to focus his immigration enforcement away from so-called Dreamers brought to the United States as children.But Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush also used executive action to protect the spouses and children of immigrants who were granted legal status under 986 immigration reform ‚Äî arguably using their executive authority to extend the law beyond Congressional action.The Republican base may now retroactively condemn their hero Ronald Reagan for "amnesty," but they don't condemn him as a domineering tyrant. Yet while President Obama has issued fewer executive orders than his predecessors, Republicans regularly smear Obama for acting like a "king" ‚Äî repeated just this week by Sen. Rand Paul.Speaker John Boehner has said if President Obama acts on his own to give relief to our nation's 11 million undocumented immigrants, he will in effect "poison the well" for any compromise legislation. And yet it is Boehner who already poisoned the political landscape, failing to wrangle a Republican caucus that has continually proven itself ungovernable and yet now has the full responsibility to govern.It doesn't seem to matter what principles or ideals Republicans embraced in the past. Their essential ideology right now is anti-Obama. Remember, these are the same "leaders" who shut down our federal government, at an economic cost of $24 billion, basically out of spite.President Obama has shown plenty of good faith effort to compromise with Republicans in general and around immigration reform in particular. As the President said in his post-midterms press briefing:"The Senate on a bipartisan basis passed a good bill. It wasn't perfect, it wasn't exactly what I wanted, but it was a sound, smart piece of legislation that really would greatly improve not just our immigration system but our economy and would improve business conditions here in the United States and make sure that American-born workers aren't undercut by workers who are undocumented and aren't always paid a fair wage and as a consequence, employers who are breaking the rules are able to undercut folks who are doing the right thing."That's what governing looks like ‚Äî working together on compromise legislation for the good of the country, not political posturing. Indeed, Republicans have the most to gain from supporting immigration reform.After the 2012 elections, GOP Chairman Reince Priebus led an "autopsy" arguing that, among other moves, Republicans must show leadership on immigration reform or risk permanently alienating the growing percentage of Latino voters. But now, after the midterms? Priebus tried to blame Obama for inaction on immigration reform. For added measure, Priebus all but called the President of the United States of America a liar: "I don't believe a thing he says," Priebus told CNN.Leadership is more than name-calling. Leadership is more than flip flopping on principles. Leadership is more than being against whatever the other side is for. Leadership is working together to solve problems.It's time Republicans finally step up, grow some cojones and lead on immigration reform. And if they fail to do so ‚Äî again ‚Äî then President Obama will be right to take action on his own and show leadership. After all, someone has to.Read CNNOpinion's new Flipboard magazine.Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.</content>

        <content>Washington (CNN) -- Under court order, the Justice Department turned over nearly 65,000 pages of documents Monday night pertaining to the botched Fast and Furious gun operation.For years, these documents have been at the center of a dispute between the Obama administration and congressional Republicans, who demanded the documents back in 2011 as part of the investigation into the case.The documents were previously withheld under the administration's claim of executive privilege.They portray the behind-the-scenes effort at the Justice Department to respond to the beginnings of the scandal over a flawed operation run by agents from Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and prosecutors in the Phoenix U.S. Attorney's Office.Suspected gun traffickers were allowed to buy thousands of weapons, many of which turned up at violent drug cartel crime scenes in the United States and Mexico. The operation was exposed when a U.S. border agent was killed in a shootout near the Arizona-Mexico border and two firearms tied to Fast and Furious suspects were recovered at the scene.Want to know more about Fast and Furious? Get the fast factsAt first, the Justice Department incorrectly said that the ATF always tried to stop weapons from being trafficked.After months of revelations from whistleblowers, the Justice Department acknowledged the scope of Fast and Furious, and the scandal badly damaged Attorney General Eric Holder's standing. He became the first sitting Cabinet member to be held in contempt of Congress.Rep. Darrell Issa, R-California, chairman of the House Oversight and Government Affairs Committee, said the documents turned over don't satisfy a lawsuit he spearheaded seeking materials.Issa said in a statement: "When Eric Holder wants to know why he was the first Attorney General held in criminal contempt of Congress, he can read the judge's order that compelled the production of 64,280 pages that he and President Obama illegitimately and illegally withheld from Congress."Since these pages still do not represent the entire universe of the documents the House of Representatives is seeking related to the Justice Department's cover-up of the botched gun-walking scandal that contributed to the death of a Border Patrol agent, our court case will continue."I am deeply concerned that some redactions to these documents may still be inappropriate and contrary to the judge's order in the case. This production is nonetheless a victory for the legislative branch, a victory for transparency, and a victory for efforts to check executive branch power."As the production is extensive and may contain sensitive information, our investigative staff will be carefully examining the documents."The documents weren't publicly released. But CNN reviewed a handful of the documents, which portray Holder frustrated as he tries to manage a controversy spiraling out of his control.In one April 2011 email exchange, he cautions aides against moving too forcefully to help block an Issa subpoena of a gun dealer who was helping law enforcement in an investigation.Holder lashed out: "Issa and his idiot cronies never gave a damn about this when all that was happening was that thousands of Mexicans were being killed with guns from our country. All they want to do -- in reality -- is cripple ATF and suck up to the gun lobby. Politics at its worst."The remark was a harbinger of a worsening relationship between Holder and Issa, which became public in bitter confrontations during congressional hearings.Brian Fallon, a Justice Department spokesman, said, "We have long been willing to provide many of these materials voluntarily in order to resolve this matter outside of court, and believe that producing them now should bring us a big step closer to concluding this litigation once and for all."The official said the documents provided Monday don't contradict what the Justice Department has said about the Fast and Furious operation and support an inspector general's finding that Holder didn't know about Fast and Furious before the controversy erupted.</content>
