        <content>(CNN) -- NATO has scrambled fighter jets more than 400 times this year to intercept Russian military flights close to alliance members' airspace in Europe, the alliance's secretary general said this week.That's a 50% increase in Russian air activity over last year and the kind of activity that harkens back to the days of the Cold War, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said during a visit to NATO member Estonia on Thursday."This pattern is risky and unjustified. So NATO remains vigilant. We are here. And we are ready to defend all allies against any threat," he said at Amari Airbase in Estonia, where U.S., German and Estonian troops were gathered.Stoltenberg said few of the Russian flights had actually violated the airspace of NATO nations, but he said the way the Russian planes operate threatens civilian aviation in the region."They are not filing their air flight plans. They are not turning on the transponders. And they are not communicating with the civilian air traffic control," he said."We are calling on Russia to conduct their military air activities in a responsible way and respecting international norms for this kind of air activity," Stoltenberg said.In a report earlier this month, the European Leadership Network listed more than 40 "close military encounters between Russia and the West" that took place in the eight months from March to October of this year.Three of those, including a near collision between a Russian military plane and a Swedish passenger aircraft carrying 132 people, were classified as "high-risk" incidents that could have led to direct military confrontation between Russia and the West, according to the report, titled "Dangerous Brinksmanship."Russia also has said it will expand its military flights, with Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu saying this month that Russian military aircraft would be flying along U.S. coasts and even into the Gulf of Mexico."We have to maintain (Russia's) military presence in the western Atlantic and eastern Pacific, as well as the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico," including sending bombers "as part of the drills," Shoigu said.Stoltenberg, continuing his Baltic trip in NATO ally Lithuania on Friday, said the alliance is not standing idle as Russian activity increases.Visiting the Karmelava Airspace Control Center, he said NATO's air policing mission in the region "has been significantly strengthened in the recent months.""And we have also deployed more ships in the Baltic Sea. And since the start of this year, NATO allies have conducted over 200 exercises," Stoltenberg saidCNN's Richard Allen Greene, Greg Botelho and Faith Karimi contributed to this report.</content>

        <content>(CNN) -- For years Venice has battled the effects of rising waters on its historic architecture, but now it's facing a new threat -- wheeled suitcases.City officials have become so tired with the cacophony of rumbling luggage they're introducing fines of up to 500 euros ($620) for anyone caught using one.The move, due to come into effect in May 2015, is likely to create a headache for many of 22 million who annually visit the city and need to cart bags to hotels in car-free streets.For locals, long tired of plastic or hard rubber wheels rattling past their windows as they try to sleep, it will come as a welcome relief.The new rules, which will require luggage to be transported on quieter air-filled tires, are the idea of City Commissioner Victor Zapparlorto, according to the Il Messaggero newspaper.MORE: Insider guide to Venice'Serious discomfort'City officials have reportedly said the noise from hard-wheeled suitcases and traders using trolleys was causing "serious discomfort."There were also concerns about the "progressive deterioration" of historic marble steps, stone pathways and footbridges around Venice's old canals.The local Il Gazzettino newspaper says the new rule will be legally binding as it'll be written into local building codeZapparlorto has suggested the legislation will be an opportunity for an entrepreneurial luggage to cash in in by creating a Venice-friendly suitcase that runs on soft tires.Whether or not the idea takes off could depend on how loud the rumblings of complaint from visitors are.MORE: The suitcase you can ride to the airportDo you think Venice is right to ban wheeled suitcases?

        <content>London (CNN) -- Three British men have been accused of plotting to decapitate a member of the public in the street, a court in London heard Thursday.British prosecutors said the men were inspired by a speech from the terror group ISIS, which called for attacks on "disbelievers."Nadir Sayed, 21; Yousaf Syed, 19, and Haseeb Hamayoon, 27, were charged Thursday with preparing acts of terrorism, according to London's Metropolitan Police.Prosecutor Rebecca Munday claimed the men planned to behead a member of the public with knives."These are serious charges, the evidence of which has been set out in a lengthy case summary," Munday told the court."In relation to that this appears to be an incident where there was an attack planned in the United Kingdom which seemed imminent."The suspects were arrested in and around London on November 6 in the run-up to Remembrance Sunday -- when Britain marks the end of World War I -- along with a fourth man who was later released without charge.Armed police -- who are rarely deployed in the United Kingdom -- took part in three of the four arrests, though no shots were fired, police said at the time.The accused had been held in custody for two weeks -- the maximum time allowed under UK anti-terror laws before suspects must be charged.There's been a marked increase in the number of people taken into custody recently under Britain's Terrorism Act 2000.Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said last month that counter-terrorism officers were "running exceptionally high numbers of counter-terrorism investigations, the likes of which we have not seen for several years."In the year up to October 17, there had been 218 terror-related arrests, he said, adding that officers are disrupting "several attack plots a year."Many of the most recent terrorism-related arrests have been in London, the nation's capital and the site of deadly coordinated 2005 suicide attacks, as well as the 2013 public slaying of British soldier Lee Rigby -- who was hit with a car and then attacked with knives by two men who were later found guilty of his murder and imprisoned for life.The UK government raised its terror threat level from "substantial" to "severe" -- the fourth-highest of five levels -- in late August in response to ISIS militants' surge in Iraq and Syria and their threats against the West. At the time, UK Home Secretary Theresa May said "that means that a terrorist attack is highly likely, but there is no intelligence to suggest that an attack is imminent."None of the men in court Thursday entered a plea. They are next due to appear at London's Central Criminal Court on December 4.CNN's Richard Allen Greene and Nick Thompson contributed to this report.</content>

        <content>(CNN) -- A self-professed American dating expert who has said he feels like the most hated man in the world has been banned from entering another country -- Britain.The UK has declined to issue a visa to Julien Blanc, an executive coach at Real Social Dynamics (RSD), a group that charges clients thousands of dollars to learn what have been described as sexist, misogynistic and violent acts towards women.On its website, RSD describes itself as the world's largest dating coaching company, and promises to teach clients how to "attract the women you've always wanted.""All of the material that we teach works amazingly well on women of younger age groups, and works just as well on women that are older and more mature," the website says.Earlier this month, Blanc was forced to leave Australia after an online campaign pushed venues to cancel his bookings, and authorities to revoke his visa."This guy wasn't putting forward political ideas. He was putting forward abuse that was derogatory to women and those are values abhorred in this country," Australia's Immigration Minister Scott Morrison told Sky News.Petitions also call for him to be barred from South Korea, Brazil, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, Ireland and Iceland.Hashtag campaignBlanc first attracted attention with a video where he described his exploits in Tokyo, Japan, telling rows of seated men, "If you're a white male you can do what you want."Outraged by what she saw, Washington-based Jennifer Li started a Twitter account and hashtag to #takedownjulienblanc, which has since inspired a Facebook page of the same name.A portion of Blanc's message to clients about Tokyo was quoted in a Change.Org petition signed by 150,000 people to ban his entry to the UK."I'm just romping through the streets, just grabbing girls' heads, just like, head, pfft on the dick. Head, on the dick, yelling, 'pikachu,' with a pikachu shirt," he said.Writing in Japansubculture, Li said: "I was outraged, with him especially. How dare he violate these Japanese women's spaces! How dare he pass on his disgusting views and methods onto other men! This guy was in essence, assaulting women and getting away with it. And not just getting away with it -- he was REWARDED for it. I could not believe that he could go about doing this without consequences."Men silencing my speech silencing @RSDJulien speech about #ChokingGirlsAroundTheWorld #takedownjulienblanc pic.twitter.com/gWqBDDj6ceBlanc issues apologyIn his first interview since the storm of criticism sought to shut down his seminars, Blanc told CNN's Chris Cuomo said he'd been "overwhelmed" by the online campaign against him."I feel horrible," he said. "I'm not going to feel happy to feel like the most hated man in the world."Blanc said he was "extremely sorry" to anyone he had offended.Asked to explain images showing him clutching women's throats, posted with the hashtag #ChokingGirlsAroundTheWorld, he said: "They were a horrible attempt at humor." But he also added "they were taken out of context.""How could they be taken out of context?" Cuomo asked.Blanc said: "You can make anything look bad in a picture."Blanc said his courses were designed to "teach guys how to gain confidence.. in order to socialize with women and perhaps get into a relationship with a woman."On Tuesday, actor Russell Brand distanced himself from the controversy after he was asked to explain a photo that showed him with his arm around Blanc's shoulders.In a video tweeted to his 8.5 million followers, Brand said, "I never knew who that was... people come up to me all the time."Referring to Blanc's training, Brand said: "Any system for chatting up women is in itself questionable, but any that's based on objectifying or undermining women I'd never, never, never, never endorse."</content>

        <content>(CNN) -- A Swedish appeals court on Thursday denied WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange's latest request to dismiss an arrest warrant for alleged rape and molestation -- cases that he says are false and politically motivated.Assange, 43, has been living in London's Ecuadorian Embassy for more than two years to avoid extradition to Sweden, where prosecutors want to question him about 2010 allegations that he raped one woman and sexually molested another.Assange, who has not been charged, denies the allegations and says he fears Sweden would extradite him to the United States, where he could face the death penalty if he is charged and convicted of publishing government secrets through WikiLeaks.The Australia native has argued the warrant should be dismissed because, in part, Swedish authorities refuse to interview him at the Ecuadorian Embassy, thereby prolonging a preliminary investigation that he says should have concluded long ago.The appellate court nodded to this argument, agreeing that "the failure of the prosecutors to examine alternative avenues is not in line with their obligation ... to move the preliminary investigation forward."But it concluded that, in balance, the arrest warrant must remain in effect because the crimes alleged are serious and because "there is a great risk that he will flee and thereby evade legal proceedings if the detention order is set aside.""In the view of the court of appeal, these circumstances mean that the reasons for detention still outweigh the intrusion or other detriment entailed by the detention order," appellate judges wrote in Thursday's ruling.Another appeal expectedMichael Ratner, a U.S. attorney for Assange, expressed dismay over the ruling."The court of appeals admits the prosecutor has wrongly failed to move this case forward, but refuses to provide Assange with any remedy. It is astonishing," Ratner said in a news release.Assange's legal team has said it intends to file an appeal with Sweden's Supreme Court.Thursday's court decision follows a similar ruling by a lower Swedish court in July.Assange argues, in part, that the preliminary investigation has been open for an unacceptably long time, and that the arrest warrant improperly keeps him from going to Ecuador, which offered him asylum, or even from going outdoors. Police stand guard outside the embassy, ready to arrest him should he emerge.Swedish prosecutors say that Assange must be interviewed in Sweden, citing what they say are legal impediments to coercing an interview elsewhere.Prosecutor Marianne Ny has said that the warrant could remain in place until the statute of limitations takes effect -- five years for unlawful coercion and 10 years for rape.Assange rocketed to international fame when WikiLeaks began publishing secret government documents online.After it published the procedures manual for the U.S. detention center at Guantanamo Bay in 2007, it posted documents related to U.S. activities in Iraq and Afghanistan, and diplomatic cables from U.S. embassies.In August 2010, Swedish prosecutors issued an arrest warrant for Assange over the allegations of sexual assault from two female WikiLeaks volunteers.He turned himself in to London authorities the same year, and was remanded in custody.At the time, a judge ruled that he should be extradited to Sweden, and Assange launched a series of appeals that went all the way to the British Supreme Court. It denied his appeal.In June 2012, Assange fled to the Ecuadorian Embassy to seek asylum, which was granted in August of the same year.He's been living at the embassy in London since then.CNN's Claudia Rebaza and Faith Karimi and journalist Per Nyberg contributed to this report.</content>

        <content>(CNN) -- After landing a probe on an icy comet and possibly shedding new light on the origins of life on Earth, the European Space Agency (ESA) is now looking at scorching-hot Mercury for its next mission.The innermost planet of our solar system orbits so close to the Sun that, in some instances, surface temperature surpasses 400 °C. Areas of the planet without sunlight, on the other hand, can become as cold as -170 °C.No other planet has variations in temperature so severe.The reason for this is the absence of any significant atmosphere, which Mercury is too hot and too small to retain. With a diameter of just over 3,000 miles, it's just a third larger than the Moon, and smaller than two other moons in the solar system -- Saturn's Titan and Jupiter's Ganymede.ESA's mission to Mercury will tentatively launch on 21 July 2016, to reach Mercury's orbit seven and a half years later, in 2024. The spacecraft is called BepiColombo -- in honor of Italian space pioneer Giuseppe "Bepi" Colombo.Mercury is the least studied of the inner planets, but it has many peculiarities."Mercury is special," said Johannes Benkhoff, the project scientist in charge of the BepiColombo mission, "It's the densest planet in our solar system, even denser than Earth - if we consider uncompressed density - and has a magnetic field, like Earth, that no one expected before, so I guess it's a cool planet to go to."There are many challenging aspects to a mission to Mercury, most prominently its proximity to the Sun, with its mighty gravitational pull and intense radiation.The planet's high orbital velocity of 48 kilometers per second -- compared to Earth's 30 kilometers per second -- is also an issue. Any probe en route to Mercury must not only cover an average linear distance of 48 million miles, but carefully gauge its velocity so that it can catch the fast planet's orbit without getting sucked into the Sun's gravitational well.As a result, only two missions have visited Mercury so far.The first was NASA's Mariner 10, launched in 1973. This was the first spacecraft to use the "gravitational slingshot" technique, which uses a planet's gravity to affect the trajectory and the speed of a spacecraft, saving on fuel and time.Bepi Colombo's calculations were used to plot Mariner 10's trip to Mercury, in a maneuver that has been widely used in space exploration ever since.The second mission is still underway: it's called Messenger and it was launched -- again by NASA -- in 2004. It is currently orbiting the planet and will continue to study it well into 2015.Nevertheless, ESA feels that there is enough mystery about Mercury to warrant a third mission."Messenger found so many surprising, unexpected results that we have a lot of good reasons to follow-up on what they did," Benkhoff told CNN, "It's a huge benefit that we have this mission in that stage, because only ten years later we will be at Mercury, follow-up on what Messenger did and get a huge, wonderful exploration of this planet."The mission will, once again, use gravity assists to reach its destination: it will first complete a fly-by of Earth, essentially returning to our planet two years after launch. Then it will perform two fly-bys of Venus, before finally heading toward Mercury.Upon arrival, a module called Mercury Planet Orbiter (MPO) will separate from the rest of the spacecraft and perform a detailed study of the Mercury system. This module is designed by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, which jointly conducts the mission along with ESA.BepiColombo will help us understand how planets can form so close to their parent star, and will analyze Mercury's geology and magnetic field.It will also provide further confirmation of Einstein's general theory of relativity.Mercury's strange orbital pattern first puzzled physicists in 1845, when it was discovered that it did not conform to Newton's theory of gravity. This was later explained by relativity, which revealed that Mercury's warped orbit was due to curved space and not some unseen object.BepiColombo will be in an optimal position to gather extremely precise data about the planet's dance around the Sun, offering the ultimate validation to Einstein's idea.Read more from Make, Create, Innovate:Are obese crash test dummies to key to preventing road deaths?Turn your kitchen into an orchestra with this magic deviceAn end to all airport security lines?</content>

        <content>Editor's note: Andy Hooper is professor of geodesy and geophysics at the University of Leeds and visiting researcher at Delft University of Technology. The views expressed in this commentary are solely his.(CNN) -- For many people, any interest in the resurgence in Icelandic volcanic activity this year is now a distant memory. However, an eruption from Bardarbunga that began on August 31 continues to this day and has now emitted the most lava of any volcano in Iceland since 1947 and shows no sign of stopping.To give some sense of the scale, the volcano has now spewed so much lava to the surface that it would fill Wembley stadium to the brim more than 500 times over. And the total area of impact is over 28 square miles.READ: Pilot diverts plane to give passengers better view of volcanoUnlike a lava flow that is currently destroying homes in Hawaii, however, the lava in Iceland is flowing in an uninhabited area and has only provided stunning visual effects that have been captured by many photographers. However, toxic gas released is causing respiratory discomfort to people in nearby towns, and has even triggered pollution warnings in other countries, including Ireland, and measurable pollution peaks in the United Kingdom.So far, however, the eruption has not caused any problems from ash clouds because it is erupting beyond the ice cap. However, this could change at any time.READ: Hawaii volcano: Lava inches closer to homes, but some might stayThe caldera at the top of the volcano is dropping every day, as magma flows out from below. This is being monitored by a high-precision GPS instrument placed there by gutsy scientists of the Icelandic Met Office.The subsidence is not smooth, but lurches down in jumps coinciding with earthquakes occurring beneath the surface. This subsidence marks a slow collapse of the caldera, a process that often ends with an eruption.There are hundreds of metres of ice within the caldera, so any eruption would lead to the production of ash, once it melts its way through the ice cap; melting ice interacts with the magma, turning to steam and exploding the magma into fragments of ash.If this occurs, the eruption may well affect some flights. It would also cause destructive flooding from melting of the ice.However, we should not see any repeat of the massive airspace closure in Europe in 2010, the biggest since World War II, following the eruption of the Eyjafjallajökull volcano. That eruption stranded millions of travellers and cost the industry a massive sum.One key difference between then and now is that there is no longer an aviation "zero tolerance" policy to ash. This means that aircraft are now allowed to fly in areas containing low particle concentrations, and various efforts such as a collaboration of 26 European institutes called FUTUREVOLC, mean that models of ash concentration have been much improved since 2010.Moreover, the ash produced in 2010 was especially fine, allowing it to stay aloft for a long time. The weather at the time also conspired against civil air authorities and travellers, with dry air and consistent northerly winds causing the ash to spread deep into Europe.To be sure, there is a small chance of a much more significant eruption. Bardarbunga has had huge eruptions in the past, bigger even than the 1783-84 Laki eruption that led to a long-lived fog over much of Europe, which contributed to extreme low winter temperatures and many deaths. However, the frequency of such large eruptions is low -- separated by hundreds of years on average.That said, the timing of the next big one may have been brought forward by the shrinking of the ice caps due to climate change. The associated reduction of pressure in the mantle beneath the crust has caused magma generation rates to approximately double over the last century. But the picture here is not 100% clear cut as the altered stress state of the crust may mean that more magma freezes beneath the ground, rather than erupting.Even without a huge eruption, threats remain from the continued possibility of large floods from meltwater, with potential risk to human life. The highlands north of the Vatnajökull glacier therefore remain closed to the general public.Taken overall, there remains a possibility of a significant ash eruption in Iceland that may well impact some flights. However, despite all the risks, it is still unlikely we will witness a repeat of the travel chaos that brought European airspace to a standstill in 2010.</content>

        <content>(CNN) -- British police want to question Robert Murat, a British man living in Portugal, in connection with the disappearance of Madeleine McCann at a Portuguese resort in 2007, a source close to the investigation told CNN.Police also want to question Murat's wife and several others, according to the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.Madeleine was a few weeks shy of her fourth birthday when she disappeared from her family's holiday apartment on May 3, 2007.Her parents had left Madeleine and her younger twin siblings asleep while they went for dinner with friends at a tapas restaurant nearby. Her mother raised the alarm when she checked on the children about 10 p.m. and discovered her daughter missing.Portuguese police named Murat as an "arguido," or official suspect, some 10 days into the investigation.Murat denied the allegations and insisted he was innocent. The suspect status was subsequently withdrawn and no charges were ever brought.Murat received an apology and damages from several UK newspapers after reaching an out-of-court settlement with them over libel claims.British police had been expected to travel to Portugal next week, but that trip was delayed for reasons unknown, the source said.Murat's lawyer told CNN his client has not been informed of any British police request; Murat himself told ITV News he had been told of the development by Portuguese media.CNN's Bryony Jones contributed to this report.</content>
