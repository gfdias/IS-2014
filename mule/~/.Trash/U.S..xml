        <content>(CNN) -- The man identified as the gunman who wounded three people at Florida State University's library apparently sent packages to several acquaintances before the shooting, according to one of them.Agents from the FBI's Houston office have received a package sent by Myron May and determined that it contained nothing hazardous, Special Agent Shauna Dunlap said. Its contents aren't being made public, she said.Joe Paul of Washington, D.C., said Friday that a postal inspector had also called him to let him know he also had received a package from May. He doesn't know what's inside, except that it's nothing dangerous.Paul told CNN on Friday that May had asked him and eight others for their mailing addresses in a November 15 Facebook message."I really thought it was a wedding invitation or something," he said. "On Wednesday at 9:53 (p.m.), he said y'all should receive your packages Friday. Then I went to sleep and woke up to tragedy."May, 31, fired shots in FSU's Strozier Library around 12:30 a.m. Thursday, wounding three of the 300 or 400 students inside -- one of them critically, police said.Cell phone video posted online captured the moments after the shooting, in which students huddled inside the packed library.Officers who encountered May outside shot him when he refused to drop his weapon, police say."The suspect did not comply with the commands and actually shot at one of the officers," Tallahassee police spokesman David Northway said. "They returned fire, and the subject was killed."Two of the students wounded in the shooting were hospitalized Thursday at Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare, one in critical condition, according to the hospital. The third shooting victim, who was grazed by a bullet, was treated at the scene and not hospitalized.Paul's package from May, a 2005 FSU graduate, appears to be in a standard Postal Service Priority Mail envelope, based on a photograph Paul said May sent him as confirmation of its delivery.It was scheduled to arrive Friday, Paul said. But he is traveling and will not be home.He has called FSU and Tallahassee police about the package but does not know what will happen to it."One of two things will happen," he said. "It will be there when I get back, or someone said the FBI or police may intercept it."Dunlap said Friday that the Houston package may first go to a lab for analysis, but will eventually go to the Tallahassee Police Department, the lead agency in the investigation of Thursday's shooting.'Fears of being targeted'Tallahassee police declined Friday to comment on the packages or what they contain.Tallahassee police Chief Michael DeLeo, did however, tell reporters Thursday that May had a journal and videos in which he "expressed fears of being targeted and that he wanted to bring attention to this issue of targeting."A preliminary review of these documents and videos demonstrates "that Mr. May was in a state of crisis," DeLeo said.In September, May called police in Las Cruces, New Mexico, convinced that someone had placed cameras in his apartment and complaining that he was hearing voices through the walls, according to an incident report provided by the department.A month later, his ex-girlfriend called police, saying May believed "the police are after him and are bugging his phone and car," according to another incident report.'He did his job with distinction'May worked briefly as a felony prosecutor in Dona Ana, New Mexico, District Attorney Mark D'Antonio said."He did his job with distinction and honor," D'Antonio said Thursday.He abruptly resigned on October 16 in a letter that made no mention of any troubles, D'Antonio said.Paul, who knew May from their days at FSU and had kept in touch over Facebook, said he doesn't think May would want to hurt him. He hopes that what's inside the package will shed some light on what happened."I hope it's the answer to why," he said.CNN's Greg Botelho, Faith Karimi, Nick Valencia, Jethro Mullen, Rick Martin, Anjali Tsui, Ed Payne and Tina Burnside contributed to this report.</content>

        <content>Are you there? Share images, if you can safely(CNN) -- The snowfall largely subsided in the Buffalo area Friday after nearly 7 feet in three days, but the deadly weather emergency is far from over: An expected warmup and weekend rains mean likely flooding -- and that's just the start of the problems.The heavy snow still threatens to collapse more roofs before it melts, and officials are urging stir-crazy residents not to even think about driving unless absolutely necessary, even as some major roads began to reopen Friday.Rain starting Saturday, and a warmup to 60 degrees on Monday, mean more misery is ahead after the snowstorms that officials say have contributed to at least 13 deaths, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Friday morning."Warming will bring melting. Melting will bring water. Water will bring floods," he told reporters. "(Likely) more flooding than we have seen in a long, long time."Some roofs already have crumbled, but rain may collapse more, in part because the already heavy snow perched atop buildings will soak up this weekend's rain before it melts, Erie County officials have said.About 30 roofs collapsed from Thursday night into Friday morning, Erie County Deputy Executive Richard Tobe told reporters Friday morning.With the rain and melting, some communities will be at risk of flooding through Tuesday"(We) expect 5 to 6 feet of water in some areas in a short period of time," Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz said.Some major roads, such as parts of the New York State Thruway, will reopen Friday afternoon, and some local driving bans are being lifted -- but largely so that trucks can deliver food to stores and crews can remove abandoned vehicles, Cuomo said.He added that no one should drive unless necessary."If you have a nonessential purpose, now is not the time to be driving around," Cuomo said. "The roads are still dangerous."Snow and vehicle removals still are major tasks ahead. Erie County crews have had to deal with clearing 1,800 lane-miles of county roads before getting to residential streets, Poloncarz said Friday.Cities and towns may have had more success with residential areas; 93% of hard-hit south Buffalo's residential streets had been plowed at least once by Friday, Mayor Bryon Brown said.Man found dead in vehicle; two seniors dead after evacuationThe latest of the 13 deaths to be counted is a 50-year-old man whose body was found in a vehicle in Cheektowaga, New York, Poloncarz said.The death toll also includes two senior citizens who died of natural causes after or while they were evacuated Thursday from a nursing home in Cheektowaga, Erie County officials said. Residents of the 184-bed Garden Gate Health Care Facility were evacuated because officials believed the roof was ready to collapse under several feet of snow.Residents had reported wall cracks and a sagging ceiling.It wasn't immediately clear if the two residents' deaths were related to the evacuation, but Erie County officials added those deaths to the 11 others this week connected to the snowfall.And the storm forced the NFL to announce that Sunday's game between the Buffalo Bills and the New York Jets, scheduled to be played at the Bills' Ralph Wilson Stadium, will take place at Detroit's Ford Field on Monday night.But even leaving the Buffalo area had its complications. Before meeting at the Bills' stadium Friday morning to get on a bus to the airport, some of the players had to be picked up by snowmobile because of driving bans in certain areas, team spokesman Scott Berchtold said.Seeking shelterAt the Winchester Volunteer Fire Company station on Harlem Street, as many as 40 people stranded in the snow have sought shelter since Tuesday. More than 6 feet of snow cover the streets. Abandoned cars are barely visible under the drifts.Fire trucks can't leave the station. Attempts by firefighters to get out in an SUV were futile. One medic hopped onto a snowmobile to rush to a call. Other volunteers jumped onto ATVs to reach a home where the roof was buckling under the weight of the snow.Maria Odom's two cats and a dog were rescued from the house."I'm ready for it to end," Odom, 38, said of the extreme weather. "I've lived here my whole life and I've never seen anything like this."At the fire station, driver Steve Randall's truckload of milk and eggs has served as the main source of provisions. Randall said he was stuck in his truck for nearly five hours before making his way to the firehouse, where people have been sleeping on tables to stay off the cold floor."We've been eating like kings for a while, but now we're running out of food," he said. Firehouse occupants have been making quiche, served with milk and bread from a store across the street.From the Tops grocery store nearby, people hauling bags of food headed out into the snow by foot. One man dragged groceries in a sled; another pulled his child through the snow in a laundry basket. Robert Mead embarked on a 5-mile trek to bring formula to his 9-month-old baby.Nearly a year's snowfall in three daysResidents just stared out their windows at the mounds of white stuff, if they could see out at all.In East Aurora, Lisa Gutekunst's home was capped with more than 4 feet of snow, she said Thursday."The snow is coming down so hard you can't see out the window," she said. "We've cleared our driveway so many times that we've run out of places to put the snow."The 86 inches that fell in some areas in three days come close to a year's worth of snow. In a typical year, Buffalo's snowfall totals about 7 feet, according to the National Weather Service.Extreme conditions lead to tragedyThe 10 other people who died included four who suffered cardiac issues while they shoveled snow and one who died in a car accident, Erie County officials reported. A man in his 60s had a heart attack while he tried to move a snowplow or a snowblower, said Tobe, the Erie County deputy executive.Two residents, from Niagara and Erie counties, died of apparent exposure Wednesday night or Thursday morning, Dr. Gale R. Burstein, Erie County health commissioner, said Thursday."They both had chronic illnesses," she said. "They both had mental health issues, and were found outside either their home or a close friend's home. They had probably been there overnight."Brown, the Buffalo mayor, and other city officials recounted stories of rescuers trudging around snowdrifts as high as houses to get people to hospitals, and police officers delivering special baby formula to a pair of infants.CNN's Alexandra Field, Leigh Remizowski, Ashley Fantz, Ed Payne, Marcus Hooper, Martin Savidge, Catherine E. Shoichet and Jill Martin contributed to this report.</content>

        <date>2014-11-20T23:57:00.000Z</date>
        <author>By Jamie Crawford, National Security Producer</author>
        <content>Washington (CNN) -- China and "probably one or two other" countries have the capacity to shut down the nation's power grid and other critical infrastructure through a cyber attack, the head of the National Security Agency told a Congressional panel Thursday.Admiral Michael Rogers, who also serves the dual role as head of U.S. Cyber Command, said the United States has detected malware from China and elsewhere on U.S. computers systems that affect the daily lives of every American."It enables you to shut down very segmented, very tailored parts of our infrastructure that forestall the ability to provide that service to us as citizens," Rogers said in testimony before the House Intelligence Committee.Rogers said such attacks are part of the "coming trends" he sees based on "reconnaissance" currently taking place that nation-states, or other actors may use to exploit vulnerabilities in U.S. cyber systems.A recent report by Mandiant, a cyber-security firm, found that hackers working on behalf of the Chinese government were able to penetrate American public utility systems that service everything from power generation, to the movement of water and fuel across the country.Related: Mandiant - China is sponsoring cyber espionage"We see them attempting to steal information on how our systems are configured, the very schematics of most of our control systems, down to engineering level of detail so they can look at where are the vulnerabilities, how are they constructed, how could I get in and defeat them," Rogers said. "We're seeing multiple nation-states invest in those kinds of capabilities."Admiral Rogers declined to identify who the other countries, beside China, because of the classified nature of their identities. Russia is generally regarded as also having an aggressive cyber program.In addition to nation-state actors, Admiral Rogers noted the increasing presence of "surrogate" criminal actors in cyberspace that serve to obscure the hidden hand of criminal activity done on behalf of formal nation-states."That's a troubling development for us," Rogers said.Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Michigan, the retiring chairman of the committee, called the groups "cyber hit men for hire" for nation-state actors in cyberspace.The testimony also comes in the wake of a report from the Pew Internet and American Life Project that cited a prediction by technology experts that a catastrophic cyber-attack that causes significant losses in life and financial damage would occur by 2025.Related: Catastrophic cyber attack loomsAdmiral Rogers told the committee he did not disagree with the assessment.In addition to the threats from specific nation-states, Admiral Rogers said there are already groups within the U.S. cyber architecture who seek to cause major damage to corporate and other critical sectors of the American economy."It is only a matter of the when, not the if, that we are going to see something traumatic." he said.</content>

        <author>By Michael Martinez, CNN</author>
        <content>(CNN) -- About 4.7 million Graco and Century-branded strollers are being recalled after its maker received reports of 10 full or partial fingertip amputations and one laceration, federal officials said Thursday.Eleven models of strollers have a folding hinge on the side that "can pinch a child's finger, posing a laceration or amputation hazard," officials said.Caregivers are being advised to show "extreme care when unfolding the stroller to be certain that the hinges are firmly locked before placing a child in the stroller," the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission said."Caregivers are advised to immediately remove the child from a stroller that begins to fold to keep their fingers from the side hinge area," the agency said.Atlanta-based Graco Children's Products received six reports of fingertip amputation, four reports of partial-fingertip amputation and one finger laceration, the product safety agency said.The firm manufactured the strollers in China and will be providing a free repair kit beginning in December.About 202,000 strollers were also sold in Canada, and about 10,300 more were sold in Mexico, the federal agency said.Graco said its recall is voluntary."Over the past 60 years, safety has been and will continue to be the priority at Graco," the firm said on its website. "As part of our continuous effort to provide quality and safe products, Graco identified that select stroller models, including some of our LiteRider models that were sold before the updated hinge was available, have folding hinges that could in rare circumstances have the potential to pinch a child's finger, posing a laceration or amputation hazard."The recalled models are Aspen, Breeze, Capri, Cirrus, Glider, Kite, LiteRider, Sierra, Solara, Sterling and TravelMate model strollers and travel systems.The models bear a manufacture date from August 1, 2000, to September 25, 2014, and were sold at Target, Toys R Us, Walmart and other retail stores nationwide and online. The prices were $40 to $70 for the strollers and $140 to $170 for the travel systems.</content>

        <highlights>NEW: Two more women have made allegations; Cosby's lawyer says they're incredulous</highlights>
        <highlights>Cosby has either denied or declined to address numerous allegations against him</highlights>
        <highlights>That hasn't stopped parade of accusers who say he drugged, sexually assaulted them</highlights>
        <highlights>Lawsuit alleged 13 Jane Does had similar accusations; several have surfaced recently</highlights>
        <date>2014-11-21T17:36:00.000Z</date>
        <author>By Eliott C. McLaughlin and Ben Brumfield, CNN</author>
        <content>(CNN) -- It seems lately as if every day brings another allegation that further dismantles Bill Cosby's image as the jovial, pudding-loving patriarch whose family-friendly brand of comedy tickled successive generations.Though the star has vehemently denied most of the accusations that he drugged and sexually assaulted young women seeking career guidance, the stories are taking their toll on his reputation and bankroll.The stories of Cosby's purported misdeeds have been around for about a decade, but they recently got new life when a comedian took aim at him and a social media stunt inviting fans to meme the comic went awry.Cosby, 77, has never faced a judge or jury, let alone been convicted, over the allegations. But it's clear many people have already tried him in their minds.When an NPR reporter gave him a chance to deny the allegations, Cosby provided an awkward moment of radio silence, refusing to answer the question. Given the same chance by The Associated Press, he offered no comment. When the interview concluded, he told a reporter that asking him about the allegations was a mark of low integrity and said he'd be appreciative if that portion of the interview was "scuttled."Here's a rundown of the alleged events altering Cosby's image:Linda Joy TraitzLinda Joy Traitz has a criminal record in Florida and spent time in prison on a conviction of drug trafficking, according to state records.Cosby's lawyer, Martin D. Singer, passed on her lengthy rap sheet as an indication to her character.But Traitz spoke openly about her record to CNN, including her last arrest in 2008, which led to more than three years in prison for drug trafficking and possession."When I got sent to prison ... it saved my life," she said. "It was a great experience for me." It ended her addiction to pain pills, and she's been clean ever since, she said.Numerous arrests speckle Traitz' rap sheet, including on suspicion of theft, battery and types of deception -- fraud and impersonation -- often in connection with drug possession.She said Cosby pushed himself on her when she worked as a waitress at a restaurant in Los Angeles that Cosby co-owned when she met him in 1969.Billboard Magazine mentioned Cosby co-owned a restaurant in a 1970 article.Traitz was either 18 or 19 at the time, she said; she did not recall exactly. But she was fresh out of high school and new to the city, she said.Cosby offered her a ride home but on the way, told her he'd like to swing by the beach with her in his Rolls Royce, she said. They parked, and he offered her drugs, an array of brightly colored pills, "to relax," she alleged.She said no, a few times. "He kept offering me the pills," she alleged, and it made her feel uncomfortable. She claimed that he then groped her chest, pushing her down in the seat and toward the door, and tried to lay on top her.She got out of the car and ran, she said. She added that she was "absolutely not" raped. He tried to calm her, she said, then drove her home in silence.Cosby's attorney said her account was not true."Ms. Traitz is the latest example of people coming out of the woodwork with fabricated or unsubstantiated stories about my client," Singer said in a statement.Louisa Moritz"We've reached a point of absurdity."That was the reaction of Cosby's attorney when former actress Louisa Moritz told her story to entertainment website TMZ."The stories are getting more ridiculous. Now this woman is claiming that something occurred more than 40 years ago and that while she was waiting in the dressing room to appear on the Tonight Show, my client forced his penis into her mouth," the statement read.That is what TMZ reported that Moritz alleged.She was in the green room at NBC in New York, when Cosby paid her a visit, she alleges. He offered to turn her into a "major star through his direction," she told TMZ.Then he forced himself on her, she alleged.Moritz was known for her roles mostly as a blonde bombshell, according to her IMDb profile. She is probably best known for her role as a prostitute in "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest."In real life, she was anything but mindless, IMDb wrote. She was a licensed lawyer in California, and made the dean's list in law school.Singer also called her credibility into question over disciplinary action the state bar took against her over a legal fee.She received as a disciplinary measure a "public reproval" in 2013 after taking a legal fee for work that was not performed. She refunded the fee, after the client complained to the bar, according to documents.In September this year, Moritz, who is 68, did not respond to a notice of disciplinary charges, and as a result, a court recommended her disbarment.CNN made multiple calls to numbers listed for Moritz, and has not been able to reach her.Andrea ConstandIn January 2004, Constand, then a 31-year-old staffer for the women's basketball team at Temple University -- Cosby's alma mater -- was at the comedian's Cheltenham, Pennsylvania, home when Cosby provided her medication that made her dizzy, she alleged the following year.She later woke up to find her bra undone and her clothes in disarray, she further alleged to police in her home province of Ontario, Canada, in January 2005.Though his attorney initially called Constand's claim "utterly preposterous" and no charges were filed, Cosby settled a civil suit with Constand that alleged 13 Jane Does had similar stories of sexual abuse.When Cosby attorney John Schmitt this week sent out a blanket denial of several allegations that have cropped up recently, he later amended his denial to say he wasn't referring to Constand, who resolved her differences "to the mutual satisfaction of Mr. Cosby and Ms. Constand years ago."Joan TarshisTarshis was a 19-year-old actress in 1969 when, she says, she met Cosby in Los Angeles. The two became friendly. One night after taping his sitcom, he invited her back to his bungalow and fixed her a "redeye" (a Bloody Mary topped with beer), she alleged this month."The next thing I remember was coming to on his couch while being undressed," she told Hollywood Elsewhere. "I was sickened by what was happening to me and shocked that this man I had idolized was now raping me. Of course I told no one."It was the first of two similar incidents, said Tarshis, who is now a journalist and publicist.Carla FerrignoThe now-wife of "The Incredible Hulk" star Lou Ferrigno told CNN that Cosby forcibly kissed her at his home in 1967.Carla Ferrigno said she told her husband, whom she married in 1980, about the incident about five years ago and he advised her to stay silent."I am going public (now) because I am just one more person who puts the nail in his coffin," she said.A Cosby lawyer called the media coverage of the allegation "utter nonsense.""This continuing pattern of attacks on Mr. Cosby has entered the realm of the ridiculous, with a purported 'forceful kiss' at a party in 1967, nearly 50 years ago, being treated as a current 'news story' and grossly mischaracterized as a 'sexual assault,'" attorney Singer said in a statement.Carla Ferrigno was an 18-year-old Playboy Bunny when she went with a male friend to Cosby's house. The comedian and his wife went to a movie with Ferrigno and her date, then returned to Cosby's home in Beverly Hills.She told CNN that Cosby's wife disappeared while the other three played pool.After her date left the room, Cosby grabbed her, pulled her to him and kissed her, she said."It was so unexpected and so rough. He kissed me right in the mouth."Tamara GreenIn 1970, attorney Green was an aspiring model in her early 20s. At a working lunch with Cosby and others, she was suffering from the flu and Cosby "went into some sort of office area at the back of the restaurant and he produced two capsules in his hand," she told Matt Lauer of the "Today Show." At first, they made her feel "great" and then left her "almost literally face down on the table of this restaurant."Cosby took her to her apartment and started "groping me and kissing me and touching me and handling me and you know, taking off my clothes," Green said. After telling Cosby "that if he didn't kill me and he tried to rape me, it was going to go very badly," he left two $100 bills on her coffee table and left, she said in her 2005 allegation.A lawyer for Cosby told the show, "Miss Green's allegations are absolutely false. Mr. Cosby does not know the name Tamara Green or (maiden name) Tamara Lucier, and the incident she describes did not happen.Janice DickinsonCosby was a familiar face in 1982, not only for his comedy, but also for his Jell-O and Coca-Cola commercials. Dickinson was a supermodel in her late 20s.Dickinson alleged this week that she and Cosby had dinner in Lake Tahoe, Nevada, and he gave her a glass of red wine and a pill she believed was for menstrual cramps."The last thing I remember was Bill Cosby in a patchwork robe, dropping his robe and getting on top of me. And I remember a lot of pain," she told "Entertainment Tonight."Cosby's attorney, Singer, said in a statement that Dickinson's allegation was a "fabricated lie" that contradicted what she wrote in her autobiography and what she said during a 2002 New York Observer interview.Beth FerrierFerrier told media outlets in 2005 that she met Cosby in Denver in the mid-'80s. He mentored her for a time, but one night, she said, he gave her a drugged cappuccino."I woke up in my car in the parking lot with my clothes all a mess," she said. "I wondered, I still wonder, 'What did he do with me? Why was my bra unhooked?' "The two later conducted an "on-and-off consensual affair" that lasted several years, she alleged to People magazine."He kept luring me in," Ferrier told the magazine. "I felt like I couldn't say no."At the time, Cosby's publicist told People that he had no comment.Barbara BowmanIn 1985, when Cosby was starring in his eponymous No. 1 TV show as a doting, wisecracking dad and doctor, Bowman, a 17-year-old model and actress, met Cosby in Denver. She came forward with her allegations in 2006 and recently wrote a column in The Washington Post questioning why no one listened to her the first time.According to Bowman's account, Cosby visited her numerous times, giving her acting lessons and "flying me around to major cities to events," she told Newsweek. After she turned 18, Cosby "assaulted (me) a number of times." In an incident in New York, Bowman "had one glass of wine and then I blacked out. I woke up throwing up in the toilet. ... I was wearing a white T-shirt that wasn't mine, and he was in a white robe."In an incident in Atlantic City, an angry Cosby "got on top of me and started taking his pants off and I was screaming and crying and begging him to leave me alone and I fought so hard and I was screaming so loud that he got mad and threw me aside and got away from me, and that was it."The Cosby camp replied, "Over the last several weeks, decade-old, discredited allegations against Mr. Cosby have resurfaced. The fact that they are being repeated does not make them true. Mr. Cosby does not intend to dignify these allegations with any comment."And here is a rundown of how the allegations are affecting his career:NetflixOn the Netflix website, it still lists the availability of "Bill Cosby 77" as "coming soon." However, the streaming and DVD service announced this week that the stand-up comedy special, filmed before a live audience in July, will not premiere the day after Thanksgiving as planned.The company did not elaborate, issuing a statement that said only, "At this time we are postponing the launch of the new stand up comedy special 'Bill Cosby 77.'"A Netflix spokeswoman declined to comment further.NBCNBC has also decided against moving forward with its own Cosby project.The network said Wednesday that it has opted to stop developing the comedy show, which was billed this summer as a "classic, big extended-family sitcom" revolving around Cosby."We can confirm that the Cosby project is no longer in development," NBC said.The network had no further comment.TV LandTV Land, one of the networks that have reruns of "The Cosby Show" in their lineups, quietly removed the sitcom from its programming schedule Wednesday.TV Land also deleted the "Cosby Show" page from its website.The channel did not respond to requests for comment about the disappearance of the show.CNN's AnneClaire Stapleton, Todd Leopold and Brian Stelter contributed to this report.</content>
