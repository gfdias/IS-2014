        <content>Follow us at @WorldSportCNN and like us on Facebook(CNN) -- F1 championship leader Lewis Hamilton feels like a "kid at Christmas" thanks to the dominance of his Mercedes car which was underlined again Friday as he set the fastest time in both practices for the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.Hamilton needs to finish no lower than second to teammate Nico Rosberg in Sunday's final race of the season to clinch his second world title, but after edging the German out in either session could not have wished for a better start to the weekend."It's been a good Friday. The car feels great -- the best I've ever driven here without doubt," he told the official F1 website."When you know you have a package as competitive as ours it's like being a kid at Christmas. I don't feel any particular pressure this weekend. I'll just drive the way I always drive and what will be, will be," he added.Read: Rosberg win sets up title finaleThe 29-year-old Briton clocked a best lap at the Yas Marina circuit of one minute 42.113 seconds in the second runs which finished in the twilight and under the lights.It left him 0.083 seconds clear of Rosberg, continuing the pattern of his Friday dominance this season, topping 15 out of 19 of those sessions.But Rosberg, who trails by 17 points, but with double points on offer in the final round under new rules, has claimed pole position in qualifying on no less than 10 occasions, so remains confident."In general the car felt great out there today. I just need to fine-tune it so that the set-up is exactly to my liking, then go for it and get the job done," he said.Rosberg will be hoping, assuming he can win the 55-lap finale, that another driver can come between him and Hamilton.He may have been heartened by the performance of Kevin Magnussen in the McLaren, who took third fastest in the second session.Read: Hamilton edges Rosberg in TexasHe finished just ahead of four-time champion Sebastian Vettel, who will be starting his 113th and final race for Red Bull before leaving for Ferrari.Valtteri Bottas of Williams was fifth best ahead of Daniel Ricciardo in the second Red Bull.Aussie Ricciardo is the only driver other than the Mercedes pair to win a race this season, claiming three victories in an impressive first year with the team.Friday's practice also saw a return to the timesheets for the cash-strapped Caterham team, which only made the final race of the season thanks to a crowdfunding scheme.Read: Can fan power rescue F1 team?Japan's Kamui Kobayashi and British rookie Will Stevens finished 18th and 19th but at least set a time.Two-time world champion Fernando Alonso, in his final race for Ferrari, had an electrical fault on his car and came to a halt by the side of the track at the start of the session and was unable to continue.</content>

        <content>Follow us at @WorldSportCNN and like us on Facebook(CNN) -- It's an all too familiar feeling for the high handicap golfer.The total mishit which instead of launching the ball to the heart of the green instead sees it barely leave the ground and end in deep rough.So when the same fate befell world number one Rory McIlroy at least most of the large gallery following him Friday at the World Tour Championship in Dubai could empathize.McIlroy had been in a perfect position in the middle of the seventh fairway with a five-wood in his hand as he attempted to hit the green at the par-five hole with his second shot.Read: McIlroy confirmed as Race to Dubai winnerBut hitting the lush turf before the ball, his lame effort squirted left and into an awkward position."He's human after all" was the verdict of the TV commentary team and McIlroy's followers on social media as the European Tour official website was quick to post the evidence.McIlroy could even afford a wry smile -- "a fat, low, duck-hook runner that was not intentional," was his verdict after the round -- before normal impeccable service was resumed.From the tricky position in deep rough he conjured up a superb recovery shot to within a few feet of the flag.But the Northern Irishman, who has already wrapped up the Race to Dubai, failed with the putt to encapsulate a day of missed opportunities.He was just one-under-par on the four par-five holes on the Earth Course where his incredible power gives him such an advantage.McIlroy also found the water off the tee at the last, but like on the seventh hole, recovered to make his par for a two-under round of 70.Read: McIlroy 'thrilled' by European Ryder winIt left him in a tie for second with England's Danny Willett and Richie Ramsay of Scotland at eight-under, two shots adrift of defending champion Henrik Stenson of Sweden, who followed a first round 68 with a fine 66."I just didn't quite have it," he admitted."I started to hit some better shots on the back nine and I'm happy where I am two behind with 36 holes to play," he added.McIIlroy, playing his first tournament in six weeks, is bidding to end a triumphant season on a high note, having won two majors in 2014 and climbed back to the top of the rankings.A first round 66 had left him in the joint lead with playing partner Shane Lowry of Ireland.Lowry also had an eventful round, acing the par-three 13th but also missing several other birdie opportunities to finish in a five-strong group at seven under.This also included England's Justin Rose, who carded a six-under 66, but like McIlroy could only make par on the final hole after finding the water with his opening drive.The tournament, which brings together the top 60 on the money list, is the final event of the European Tour season with an $8 million prize purse on offer.Read: Stenson: Golf's $20m man</content>

        <author>By Sarah Holt, for CNN</author>
        <content>Follow us at @WorldSportCNN and like us on Facebook(CNN) -- The worst kept secret in Formula One is finally out -- Fernando Alonso is leaving Ferrari and will be replaced by Sebastian Vettel.Red Bull's four-time world champion has signed a three-year contract with the Scuderia, the oldest team in F1, from 2015.After ending his five-year stint at Ferrari, Alonso remains coy on where he will be driving next season.The double move by two of the sport's high profile world champions is the most significant in the driver market this season.But in the fickle world of F1 there are no guarantees it will work out for either of the ambitious racers.Read: Who will be the new F1 world champion?There are still seats to be filled at McLaren, Force India and Toro Rosso. With the curtain about to fall on the 2014 season at Sunday's Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, hopeful drivers have just one more chance to stake their claim for the remaining seats.Where will Alonso go?Alonso is regarded as the best all-round driver currently racing at the elite level of motorsport, a fact many of his peers are even happily willing to acknowledge.The Spaniard -- a double world champion with Renault in 2005 and 2006 -- is regarded as the key to the F1 driver market.The 33-year-old made it clear he wanted to leave Ferrari, even though he had two years left to run on his contract with the Italian team, but he has yet to confirm where he will go next.I received so much love from the tifosi ... Special connection from the start. Magic moments. Always on my heart. pic.twitter.com/lCgUcdoRnQA return to McLaren seems most likely, despite his acrimonious departure from the team after just a single season as Lewis Hamilton's teammate in 2007.McLaren is about to embark on a new phase after reigniting its relationship with engine manufacturer Honda.Alonso is expected to lead this new era at McLaren, although the fiercely ambitious driver may first want guarantees that the Honda engine is going to be a success.Keeping the media guessing about his future -- and maybe his future employers too -- seems to have provided Alonso with plenty of sport off track.Speculation in the media has seen Alonso linked with buying the Lotus team, joining forces with German sports car specialists Audi and even ousting Nico Rosberg or Hamilton at Mercedes.Alonso remained typically tight lipped about his future plans when he was questioned by the media at the Abu Dhabi season finale.Has Vettel made the right decision?Vettel has endured his worst season at Red Bull in 2014, failing to win a race compared to three victories for his rookie teammate Daniel Ricciardo.Since his full debut season for Toro Rosso in 2008, the German has won at least one race a year, not to mention winning four straight world championships between 2010 and 2013.The 27-year-old is now hoping to succeed where Alonso failed at Ferrari by adding to his collection of world titles."The next stage of my Formula One career will be spent with Ferrari and for me that means the dream of a lifetime has come true," Vettel said."When I was a kid, Michael Schumacher in the red car was my greatest idol and now it's an incredible honor to finally get the chance to drive a Ferrari."I am extremely motivated to help the team get back to the top. I will put my heart and soul into making it happen."Vettel will partner Kimi Raikkonen -- the last man to win a world title with Ferrari in 2007 -- in 2015 but there are no guarantees the car and its Ferrari engine will be any match for the might of Mercedes.Who will drive for McLaren?McLaren has tried to dampen speculation over just who will be in its cars in 2015 in the build-up to this weekend's season-ending race."We know you're awaiting news on our driver line-up. We'll announce after December 1 -- you'll hear it here first," the team said on Twitter.Guys, we know you're awaiting news on our driver line-up. We'll announce after Dec 1 -- you'll hear it here first. All eyes now on Abu Dhabi.Alonso remains the red-hot favorite to take one of the seats but the future of current drivers Jenson Button and Kevin Magnussen remains unclear.Button -- the 2009 world champion with Brawn Grand Prix which has since morphed into Mercedes -- has remained sanguine about his future and has even explored the idea of moving to sports car racing.Danish rookie Magnussen is fiercely passionate about staying with McLaren, the team which gave the 22-year-old his F1 debut in 2014."There is no Plan B," the Dane told CNN when asked if had explored his options if he wasn't retained by the eight-time world champions.Which other teams have seats to fill?Mercedes, Red Bull, Ferrari, Williams, Lotus and Sauber have all confirmed their driver pairings for 2015. There are still seats on offer at McLaren, Force India and Toro Rosso.Force India has already announced it will retain German Nico Hulkenberg for 2015 but Mexican Sergio Perez has not had his position with the team confirmed.There's also only one seat up for grabs at Toro Rosso, who will blood 17-year-old Max Verstappen as the youngest F1 driver in history next season.Junior Red Bull driver Carlos Sainz Jr is in pole position for the second seat -- and the Spaniard has been named as a test driver for Red Bull at the end of season test in Abu Dhabi -- although Toro Rosso may still retain French racer Jean-Eric Vergne.Sauber announced Swede Marcus Ericsson and Brazilian Felipe Nasr as its 2015 drivers in November much to the chagrin of current driver Adrian Sutil, who believed he had a contract with the team for next season.Ericsson and Nasr are both pay drivers, backed by sponsors who bring an estimated $30m funding to the Swiss team.Grid shrinks to 18 in 2015?The F1 market may be flooded with plenty of eager racers but the number of seats has been squeezed.The financial pressures on the Caterham and Marussia teams, which both went into administration in October, means there are, in theory, only 18 spots on the F1 grid in 2015.After missing the U.S. and Brazil grands prix, Caterham has used crowdfunding to help finance a return in Abu Dhabi.Japan's Kamui Kobayashi retained his drive while the team has also handed Briton and former tester Will Stevens his F1 debut.Read: Is F1 running out of gas?Both Caterham and Marussia remain on the official entry list for the 2015 season but their future is dependent on a hard winter drumming up funding to stay in the sport.With teams spending a minimum of $70m per season, employing a driver who offers pace, performance and a pot of personal talent is more important than ever for those teams for can't afford super-talents like Alonso.</content>

        <content>Follow us at @WorldSportCNN and like us on Facebook(CNN) -- Marussia driver Jules Bianchi is out of an artificial coma and has been flown home to his native France, his parents said Wednesday in an update on his condition.Bianchi was left with severe head injuries after a crash at the Japanese Grand Prix on October 5 and has been treated in a high dependency unit at Yokkaichi hospital."Jules is no longer in the artificial coma in which he was placed shortly after the accident, however he is still unconscious," said the statement released by his parents Philippe and Christine.Read: Bianchi in horror crash at Japan GP"He is breathing unaided and his vital signs are stable, but his condition is still classified as 'critical'."But they added that his condition was deemed to be "sufficiently stable" for him to have been airlifted back to a hospital near the 25-year-old's family home in Nice.Bianchi's car went off the track at speed during the closing stages of the race at the Suzuka circuit nearly seven weeks ago, plowing into a recovery truck.The accident shocked the close knit world of Formula One, and many tributes have been paid to Bianchi since the accident seven weeks ago.Read: Bianchi suffered 'diffuse axonal injury'The two points he gained with a superb drive in the Monaco Grand Prix earlier this season left minnows Marussia in ninth place in the constructors' championship, but while he has been lying in a coma the team has folded after entering administration.The more hopeful news of Bianchi's repatriation, although the update stressed "the situation continues to be serious and may remain so," comes in the week of the final race of the F1 season in Abu Dhabi."We are thankful that the next phase of Jules' treatment can continue close to home, where he can be surrounded and supported by his wider family and friends."His treatment now enters a new phase concerned with brain function," it added.Read: Rosberg win sets up season-finale</content>

        <content>(CNN) -- The final round of qualifiers for the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations threw up a few surprises, the most notable of which being holders Nigeria bowing out.The results of Wednesday evening also presented some potential logistical issues, as Guinea progressed to the finals next January, highlighting the problems that Ebola fears may cloud the event.The ruling African football body, CAF, last week removed Morocco as host, handing hosting duties to 2012 co-host Equatorial Guinea.The North African country had voiced concerns over the spread of the deadly disease in a number of West African countries and requested a postponement. As a further consequence, its team has been expelled from the competition,The controversy had threatened to overwhelm the final round of games, played out this week, but by the end of Wednesday the 16 teams who will travel to the finals were known.Elephants ease into FinalsIvory Coast qualified behind Group D winner Cameroon after a goalless draw between the two teams. The result was enough to fend off a late challenge from DR Congo after its 3-1 victory over Sierra Leone in the Congolese capital of Kinshasa.DR Congo's result, however, helped the team garner an impressive total of nine points, which saw the Leopards progress as the best-performing third place team from the seven groups, narrowly beating the reigning champions Nigeria to the remaining qualifying spot.Super Eagles crash outNigeria has been a regular fixture in the finals of the competition since its early days, but will be a notable absentee in Equatorial Guinea, mirroring 2010 holders Egypt in failing to qualify for the following edition of the tournament in 2012.The Super Eagles were held 2-2 by South Africa in Uyo, giving second-place in Group A to Congo, as the team recorded a 1-0 victory over Sudan in Khartoum.The South Africans topped Group A with 12 points from their qualifying campaign.Niger and Mozambique played out a dead rubber with a 1-1 draw, with fellow Group F teams Cape Verde and Zambia already having qualified before kick-off on Wednesday.Burkina Faso's draw with Angola was also largely academic, the west African nation having already joined Gabon in qualifying from Group C.Keita magicMeanwhile, Mali booked their spot for the seventh consecutive time with a standout performance from captain Seydou Keita. The Roma midfielder opened the scoring with a well-taken penalty. Mali finished runners-up in Group B behind Algeria.A poor showing in Tunisia by Egypt saw the 2010 champions lose 2-1, and miss out on a place at the finals.Ghana's Black Stars ensured they progressed from Group F with a routine 3-1 win over neighbors Togo. They will be joined in the finals by Guinea, after a 2-0 victory over Uganda in the Moroccan city of Casablanca -- Ebola fears in the West African country ruling out home matches for the time being.The Ebola crisis threatens to loom large over the tournament. Host country of the finals, Equatorial Guinea, was disqualified earlier in the qualifying tournament for fielding an ineligible player, but were later reinstated.The final 16South AfricaCongoAlgeriaMaliGabonBurkina FasoCameroonIvory CoastGhanaGuineaCape VerdeZambiaTunisiaSenegalDR Congo (best third-place team)Equatorial Guinea (automatically qualify as hosts)</content>

        <content>Follow us at @WorldSportCNN and like us on Facebook(CNN) -- The bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups has taken a new twist as football's world governing body FIFA lodged a criminal complaint with the Swiss judiciary Tuesday.The complaint relates to the "international transfers of assets with connections to Switzerland, which merit examination by the criminal prosecution authorities."The FIFA statement added: "The subject of the criminal complaint is the possible misconduct of individual persons in connection with the awarding of the hosting rights of the 2018 and 2022 World Cup."FIFA lodged the complaint with the Attorney General of Switzerland in Berne on the recommendation of German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert -- FIFA's independent ethics adjudicator."I lodged the criminal complaint upon the recommendation of Judge Eckert," FIFA president Sepp Blatter said."I cannot, however, comment on any possible criminal offenses. I am not a lawyer."I also was not the addressee of the investigatory report, which I have never seen. However, given Judge Eckert's recommendation, it was my duty -- as the President of FIFA -- to lodge the complaint."Eckert's recommendation was based on the evidence compiled by Michael Garcia -- chairman of the investigatory chamber of the FIFA Ethics Committee -- who has been examining the awarding of the hosting rights of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.However Blatter insisted there was no change to Eckert's statement "that the investigation into the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups is concluded."Eckert, who is set to meet with Garcia on Thursday to discuss the report, says he came across "indications that pointed to suspected unlawful activity in connection with Switzerland."He told FIFA's website: "In the circumstances, I saw it as my duty to bring this to the FIFA President's attention and to recommend to him that the Swiss criminal prosecution authorities be informed."Eckert has been heavily criticized since publishing his 42-page summary into Garcia's 18-month investigation last Friday.The German told reporters last week that he had been surprised by the strength of bad feeling surrounding his summary."I would like to point out that not once did my statement involve a so-called "whitewashing" of the award process with regard to the various allegations and assumptions made, contrary to what has been claimed in some quarters," he said."My statement was based on the Garcia report -- I can only work with the material contained in it, and in my view, there was insufficient clear evidence of illegal or irregular conduct that would call into question the integrity of the award process as a whole."However, in certain places, the report does indicate that further clarification is needed of certain circumstances. Much of this clarification work can be carried out by the FIFA Ethics Committee itself, while the remainder is the responsibility of the relevant national investigatory authorities."With Garcia and Eckert set to discuss their differences over the summary on Thursday, Kevin Carpenter, who specializes in sports law for Kevin Hill Dickinson LLP, raised questions over the timing of the announcement."It's interesting that Garcia said his report had been misrepresented, yet Eckert decides to take evidence to the Swiss judiciary now," he told CNN."Why lodge the criminal complaint given they are meeting later this week?"Carpenter also believes that Garcia, who has appealed to FIFA's appeal committee over the findings in Eckert's summary, could take his complaints further."Michael Garcia has referred the matter to the appeals committee, but if his complaint is rejected he could then go to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which is extremely thorough and can look at all the evidence."CAS' decision and reasoning would be made public. Names would have to be redacted but it would be a way for the bulk of his report -- the sections he believes to be most important coming into the public domain."Read: Why women weren't good enough for World Cup reportRead: FIFA embroiled in civil war</content>

        <content>Follow us at @WorldSportCNN and like us on Facebook(CNN) -- The Qatari capital, Doha, has been selected as host of the 2019 world athletics championships, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) announced on Tuesday.Doha was chosen ahead of U.S. candidate Eugene, Oregon and Spain's entry, Barcelona at a IAAF meeting in Monaco.It is the first time in the history of the event that a Middle Eastern country has been chosen as host."It's a privilege and honor to have the trust of the IAAF," the leader of the Doha bid, Sheikh Saoud Bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said in a statement released on the IAAF website."I am very delighted that these championships are going to be in the region for the first time."I'm confident that with the support of the IAAF we will organize one of the best world championships," he added.The first world athletic championships were held at Helsinki in 1983 and have been held biennially since 1991.Beijing's "Bird's Nest" stadium -- host to the 2008 Olympic Games -- is set to host the event next year and will be followed by London in 2017."I (am) sure that in Doha we will have a wonderful edition of the world championships," said IAAF President Lamine Diack, in a statement.This is the second major world sporting event to be awarded to Qatar in recent years. In 2010, FIFA selected Qatar to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup.Read more: FIFA embroiled in civil war</content>

        <content>Follow us at @WorldSportCNN and like us on Facebook(CNN) -- Its all change for the world's top sporting event -- the Olympic Games.The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has made 40 new recommendations in an attempt to make hosting the Games more affordable.The 2014 Winter Games cost Russia an estimated $50 billion and IOC members believe such an exorbitant cost has put off potential future bidders.In September, Norway withdrew its candidature to host the 2022 Winter Olympics, while Stockholm, Krakow and Lviv also pulled out of the running.That left just two cities -- Beijing in China and Kazakhstan's Almaty -- vying to host the 2022 Games."We have to look into the future and try to address the challenges which may arise in the future and the challenges we have already now," International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach told reporters."We want to show with this procedure that the IOC is opening up, that we are opening a window and we want to have fresh wind coming in,"According to the new reforms announced on Tuesday, bidding costs will be reduced while there will also be a "significant financial contribution from the IOC."The new rules will permit the organization of events outside of the host city, as at London 2012, while in exceptional circumstances, even taken outside the host country.The IOC has also announced that it will include the non-discrimination on sexual orientation in the Olympic charter following the controversy surrounding the Sochi Games and Russia's political laws on homosexuality."Over the past year many people have asked me why there is a desire to make changes. After all, they say, the Olympic Games, the IOC, and the Olympic Movement have enjoyed many successes and we are in a very good position," said President Bach."My answer is that we are now in the position to drive change ourselves rather than being driven."We have to take leadership with Olympic Agenda 2020. We have the opportunity, and we must seize the moment -- now is the time for change."Also amongst the recommendations are plans to cap the number of athletes and coaches while the IOC wants women to make up 50% of those competing.A vote on the IOC's proposals will be held at a meeting in Monaco on 8 and 9 December.Bach has also confirmed that sports will not have to wait seven years to be approved for a place at the Olympics, insisting the IOC can propose new events."Now the door is open (for sports). The IOC by itself can also take a decision that we are adding this or that event," Bach said."It only has to happen before the city is elected so that candidates know what they have to deal with. Any changes after can happen in agreement with the host city."The Tokyo Games, which will be held in 2020, is pushing for the inclusion of baseball and softball following their exclusion from the 2008.The next Winter Games takes place in Pyeongchang, South Korea, in 2018, while Rio de Janeiro will host the Summer Olympics in two years time.Read: Winter Olympics on thin ice?Read: Russia -- do the numbers add up?</content>

        <author>By James Masters, CNN</author>
        <content>Follow us at @WorldSportCNN and like us on Facebook(CNN) -- FIFA is coming under growing pressure from some of Europe's leading football federations to take "urgent action" and restore confidence in the world governing body.Under-fire FIFA has faced heavy criticism over its refusal to publish a key report into allegations of corruption surrounding the World Cup bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 tournaments in Russia and Qatar.England's 2018 bid was singled out for particular criticism by German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert when he delivered his 42-page summary of Michael Garcia's report last week.But the English Football Association chairman Greg Dyke has hit back, confirming he will be writing to every member of the FIFA executive committee asking for full publication.Read: FIFA embroiled in civil war"I am writing to each member of the FIFA Executive Committee on behalf of the FA to urge you to insist on the publication of Mr Garcia's full report as a matter of some urgency."As you probably know the reputation of FIFA was already low in England and much of Europe before the events of last week."FIFA had hoped Eckert's summary would draw a veil over the bidding process, but that hope was scuppered when American lawyer Garcia said the 42-page report was error ridden."The failure to publish Mr Garcia's report and his statement that the summary report which was published contained "numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations" has resulted in a further decline in public confidence of FIFA," added Dyke."We cannot go on like this. Complete transparency is required if the actions of all those who bid, including England 2018, are to be judged fairly."Dyke went on to ask members of the FIFA executive committee to think of the greater good for FIFA and football."I know some of you believe that FIFA's reputation in England is the result of an obsession amongst the English media with FIFA and I know Mr Blatter sees their reports as an unfair attack on the organization he leads," said Blatter."However, in England we see it differently. If you read a whole range of English newspaper reports about FIFA, particularly those in the Sunday Times, they do provide compelling evidence of wrong doing."They cannot be simply dismissed as "racist" or "an attack on FIFA" as Mr Blatter described them at the FIFA Congress in Brazil."Urgent action is needed if confidence in FIFA is to be rebuilt in England. The FA is of the view that this action should start with the full publication of Mr Garcia's report."Dyke's move comes after the England's 2018 bid team was accused of acting improperly during the bidding process by the report.The FA was accused accused of attempting to "curry favor" with former FIFA vice-president Jack Warner, who left his role in 2011 following allegations of bribery.The report claims that the England bidding team sponsored a $55,000 gala dinner for the Caribbean Football Union, allowed the Trinidad and Tobago under-20 squad to hold a training camp in the United Kingdom in 2009 and attempted to help a "person of interest" to Warner find a job in the country.A spokesman for the FA refuted the claims in a statement on the organization's website."We note the FIFA Ethics Committee has today published a 42- page report in relation to the bidding processes for the FIFA World Cups in 2018 and 2022."We were not given any prior notice of the report before publication. We do not accept any criticism regarding the integrity of England's bid or any of the individuals involved."We conducted a transparent bid and, as the report demonstrates with its reference to the England bid team's 'full and valuable cooperation', willingly complied with the investigation. We maintain that transparency and cooperation around this entire process from all involved is crucial to its credibility."We also note that after a lengthy investigatory process and assessment, the report has concluded that the 'potentially problematic facts and circumstances identified by the report regarding the England 2018 bid were, all in all, not suited to compromise the integrity of the FIFA World Cup 2018/22 bidding process as a whole'."Simon Johnson, who was part of the England 2018 bid, told CNN last week that the report was a "politically motivated whitewash"."Even before it was published, I had no confidence in the report," he said."Now Garcia has come out and told us there are inaccuracies why should anyone believe anything?"Mr Garcia had limited powers and couldn't investigate everybody he wanted to."He didn't speak to a number of members form the executive committee."Read: FIFA embroiled in civil war</content>
