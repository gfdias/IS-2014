        <content>Jerusalem (CNN) -- The Israeli military said Friday it arrested three Palestinians from the West Bank and charged them in an alleged plot to assassinate Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman.Court documents say the scheme involved a plan to purchase rocket-propelled grenades and fire them on his convoy. Lieberman has a home in a West Bank settlement.The military suspects that the three men gathered intelligence on Lieberman's convoy.The indictment sheet says the plot was hatched in August during Operation Protective Edge -- an Israeli military assault against the Hamas military wing in Gaza, designed to stop Palestinian rocket attacks into Israel.A Hamas spokesman said he was unaware of a planned attack, but he justified it.All Israeli leaders are legitimate targets because Israeli soldiers killed Palestinian children and women, and they entered Al Aqsa mosque and attacked Palestinians, said Sami Abu Zuhri.The military and police said they also uncovered an intended gun and car attack on the Jewish West Bank settlement of Gush Etzion.Three Israeli teenagers were kidnapped there in June, contributing to tensions in the lead-up to the military action in Gaza.CNN's Amir Tal reported from Jerusalem; Ben Brumfield wrote and reported from Atlanta.</content>

        <content>(CNN) -- A 67-year-old woman who reportedly received millions in life insurance money from at least five of her previous partners has been arrested on suspicion of poisoning her last husband with cyanide -- the latest high-profile case in Japan involving so-called "black widows."Chisako Kakehi, who benefited to the tune of 800 million yen ($6.8 million) over the past 20 years, according to Japanese media, denies any wrongdoing."I didn't kill him. I don't know how to kill ..." she told police, according to CNN affiliate TV Asahi.But an autopsy report on Iso Kakehi, her fourth husband to die, found cyanide in his stomach and blood.The 75-year old died in December, less than two months after their wedding. It triggered a police investigation into the case, which culminated in Kakehi's arrest in Kyoto on Wednesday.A previous fiancé, who died when he crashed his motorcycle, was also found to have traces of cyanide in his body.Police would only say "many" of her previous partners -- who were aged between 54 and 75 -- had died in the past two decades.Autopsies rareHowever, authorities may be unable to prove she killed her other lovers because autopsies are generally rare in Japan. Her first husband died back in 1994.Kakehi is the latest "black widow" to make the headlines in Japan. Kanae Kijima is currently in prison after being found guilty of killing three men she met on dating websites in 2009 and making it look like suicide in each case. She was 37 at the time.That same year, bar worker Miyuki Ueta, 40, was found guilty of drugging and drowning two men she reportedly owed money to.Both are appealing death sentences.</content>

        <content>(CNN) -- A vehicle explodes. Two trucks full of armed men race closer to the resulting crater at the Karm el-Kawadees army camp in North Sinai. The black-clad militants chase the survivors, killing all the soldiers. All of it is captured on video.At least 31 Egyptian soldiers were killed in the October attack, the deadliest to date committed by the Sinai-based militant group Ansar Beit al-Maqdis (Champions of Jerusalem).ABM militants released video of the ambush in mid-November -- just days after pledging allegiance to ISIS, the Islamic terror group that now controls large parts of Syria and Iraq.The footage, which also shows a number of drive-by shootings and roadside bomb blasts, suggests that the group's firepower and strategic planning is becoming more sophisticated.ABM operates primarily in Northern Sinai, an area where rolling sand dunes butt up against the Mediterranean Sea and stretch to rocky mountains in the center of the Sinai Peninsula. For years this corner has been dubbed "the most dangerous part of Egypt."Since 2011, the group has been attacking Israeli interests in Sinai by repeatedly blowing up a gas pipeline leading from the Egyptian Red Sea to Israel. The group stepped up the frequency of its raids after Egypt's army overthrew President Mohamed Morsy -- a former Muslim Brotherhood leader -- following a popular uprising in July 2013.Hundreds of Egyptian troops have since been slaughtered in this low-level insurgency. In the two months leading up to the October 24 massacre at Karm el-Kawadees, the group more than doubled its attacks in North Sinai -- killing 62 police officers and soldiers, according to Aswat Masriya, an Egyptian Reuters affiliate.While looting weapons from Karm el-Kawadees, a militant proclaimed to the camera: "Tell the leader of ISIS, [Abu Bakr] al-Baghdadi, the leader of the faithful, that you are coming here and we are your soldiers."The group has changed its logo and its name to Wilayat Sinai -- "the State of Sinai" -- positioning itself as part of the bigger ISIS "caliphate" that extends from northern Syria to central Iraq.Several other militant groups from the region have also pledged allegiance to ISIS, including in Libya, which shares a long porous border with Egypt that is known for being an arms-smuggling route.These pledges benefit ISIS, whose territorial expansions have already peaked and are now stagnant, explains H. A. Hellyer, from the Center of Middle East Policy at Brookings Institution."It may well be very possible that ABM decided that in order for it to maintain its own type of momentum, to become part of a broader transnational group, would be in its own interest," Hellyer told CNN.Observers note the scarcity of verified information coming from Sinai; the military limits access to the wild terrain believed to be the group's home and the surrounding towns and villages.Most concerns about ABM's recent pledge of allegiance to ISIS are focused on the possible increase in recruitment and expertise."First thing it means is that any Egyptians currently fighting with ISIS and Daesh in Syria or Iraq have a second arena to go and fight in without leaving the group," Hellyer said. "They'll add that expertise, they'll add that training to the capacity of [ABM]."Unlike ISIS, Ansar Beit al-Maqdis mostly refrains from targeting civilians. The group has almost exclusively attacked the government, aside from one recent ABM video purporting to show the beheading of four civilian men who were accused of spying for Israel.In a video claiming responsibility for the attempted assassination in 2013 of Egypt's Minister of Interior, ABM said it chose the site of the suicide bombing to minimize Muslim civilian casualties.It pits itself as a defender of the people against what it calls the "apostate" army. Its statements often cite videos of Egypt's army attacking protesters in 2011, the killing of more than one thousand Morsy supporters in August 2013 and, most recently, a leaked video of Egyptian soldiers torturing two Sinai Bedouins. ABM also cites pictures of militants killed by security forces in Sinai as further proof of abuses."You all saw what [security forces] did to Muslims in Egypt and in all squares. This army has crossed all lines. This army did what the Pharaoh didn't do with his people," warns an unidentifiable militant in one ABM video. "We will kill you all, you apostates."Sitting in front of a cache of weapons supposedly taken from the Karm el-Kawadees camp, ABM's presumed leader said he would free the "prisoners of war" held by authorities."We told you before, the war hasn't started yet. And what's coming is worse and bitter. This is only the beginning. You opened a door you won't be able to close," he said, clad in black clothing with his face blurred.Following the October attack, the government ordered the evacuation of houses along the Egypt-Gaza border, creating a one-kilometer-wide buffer zone, in a bid to curtail smuggling of arms through the Gaza tunnels.In a video showcasing its capabilities under the banner of "a fierce military operation to purge Sinai from the grip of terrorism and criminals", Egypt's army also included interviews with evacuees assuring the public that they did so willingly and received proper compensations.The residents of northern Sinai have long complained of being neglected by Cairo. The lack of job opportunities and development -- along with a general mistrust between Bedouin peoples and the government -- has created fertile ground for the rise of ABM."This is collective punishment by the army and the police," said Sherif Mohy El-Din, a counter-terrorism researcher at the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights. "The army has been destroying houses of the people and burning their cars and motorcycles for the past two years."Terrorist attacks have only increased as the government has stepped up operations since July 2013, observed Mohy El-Din, who argues that the that the narrow focus on security is counterproductive and is only making the situation worse."It's very complicated. It has a lot of dimensions, economic and political. We are dealing with a regime that since July 2013 has been saying 'It's me and only me, no parliament or elections,'" said Mohy El-Din. Opening the public sphere for competing viewpoints, he argued, would help curb terrorism.But defeating ABM will take more than establishing security. Mohy El-Din says the government first needs to improve the lives of the civilians in the area.In the meantime, ABM is no longer confined to Sinai. It has launched attacks in the Nile Delta, in Cairo, and against Israel -- the group's original enemy.In Cairo, observers worry that the heavy hand of security services in cracking down on dissent is fueling the violence. It provides grounds for recruitment for groups like ABM and is reflected in the spike in number of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) defused or detonated in the Nile Valley. ABM has only claimed responsibility for a few of these attacks.But despite the rise in number and sophistication of attacks, Mohy El-Din believes Egypt is safe for tourists and civilians -- at least for now."Now, ABM is not targeting civilians," he told CNN. "But if it gets worse and they don't see hope, then maybe."The government sees the threat within a regional context. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has expressed support for the global war on ISIS. And at home, he remains resolute."They assume that we are incapable of confronting them. They started the fire. We were very careful that no blood is shed. But unfortunately, they wanted the exact opposite," the former defense minister, elected president last summer, said 10 days after the October attack.El-Sisi said he wasn't shaken by the attack -- and refused to direct his anger at military leadership, as some voices critical of security failures have called for. He ridiculed ABM's attempts to create an "emirate" out of Sinai, pledging that no one would crack the enduring unity of Egypt.It's impossible for ABM to eliminate the Arab world's largest military. Yet until there is a victor, the death toll will continue to rise. As the group declared in one video, it seems more determined than ever to expand: "We will eliminate borders. No passports, no visas and no borders. It's not just about Sinai."</content>

        <content>(CNN) -- A Honduran beauty queen and her sister were found dead Wednesday, police said, and the sister's boyfriend and another man have been arrested.The bodies of María José Alvarado Muñoz, the reigning Miss World Honduras, and her sister, Sofia Trinidad Alvarado, were found buried in a shallow grave in a mountainous area beside a river, Honduran authorities told CNN affiliate Televicentro.The bodies of the sisters, who had been missing for several days, were found on top of each other, Santa Barbara Mayor Juan Alvarado told the outlet.Plutarco Antonio Ruiz Rodriguez and Aris Valentin Maldonado Mejia are now in police custody, and investigators believe more people are involved in the sisters' deaths, Police Deputy Commissioner Rolando Casco Torres told Televicentro.Ruiz was Sofia's boyfriend, police say, according to CNN en Español.The sisters disappeared Thursday night after going to a spa for a birthday party for Ruiz in Santa Barbara, northwest of the capital of Tegucigalpa, police told CNN en Español.Ruiz is suspected of killing the two sisters, said Leandro Osorio, chief of the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation.Ruiz also "is considered the person who was most in contact" with the victims, Casco added, according to Televicentro.Edgardo Casana, a congressman from Santa Barbara, said the two women, their other sister and Ruiz were all students of his when they were younger. In fact, Casana, a teacher, said he knew the three sisters' family well, and that Ruiz was also in a youth soccer league with Casana's children, he said."I'm dismayed by what happened," Casana told the CNN affiliate.As a boy in Casana's class and in the soccer league, Ruiz was temperamental but also quiet, humble and gentle, Casana said. Ruiz's nickname was Paco, the official said.In fact, Casana just saw Ruiz on Monday in Santa Barbara, the congressman said."We talked about soccer," Casana said.Alvarado, 19, was supposed to leave for London soon to participate in the Miss World pageant, police said.Their family reported the women's disappearance on Saturday. Their mother, Teresa Muñoz, initially believed her two daughters were kidnapped.Eduardo Zablah, director of the pageant in Honduras, told Televicentro that Alvarado and her sister were last seen getting into a vehicle after attending a party last week.The young woman was to be among the contestants from more than 120 countries who arrive in London this week for early rounds of the Miss World pageant. The final round is scheduled for December 14.A student from Santa Barbara, Honduras, Alvarado beat 18 contestants to win the Miss World Honduras crown in April.In her profile on the pageant's website, she described herself as "dedicated" and said she would someday like to go into government, specifically as a diplomat for her country.She also said that she liked playing volleyball and soccer, eating Honduran food and performing the country's traditional punta dance.Julia Morley, the chairman of the Miss World pageant, said contestants will hold a special service Sunday to honor Alvarado and her sister and offer prayers for their families."We are devastated by this terrible loss of two young women, who were so full of life," Morley said.Honduras has the world's highest murder rate, the United Nations reported earlier this year, with 90.4 homicides per 100,000 people in 2012.Journalist Elvin Sandoval, reporting from Tegucigalpa, Honduras, and CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet and Greg Botelho in Atlanta contributed to this report.</content>

        <content>(CNN) -- Ebola has officially been eradicated from the Democratic Republic of Congo, the World Health Organization declared Friday, even amid fresh concerns about the deadly virus in places like Sierra Leone and Mali.The United Nations health agency cleared the DRC for Ebola because 42 days had passed since tests came back negative on the last person with the disease and there have been no other cases since.The WHO credited the central African country's leadership and effective coordination, including steps to monitor those with the disease and the people they had been in contact with, for the milestone. This marks the seventh Ebola outbreak in the DRC since the virus was first identified in 1976, the agency said.The Democratic Republic of Congo has had 38 confirmed and 28 probable reported Ebola cases in recent months. Of those, 49 people -- including eight health care workers -- have died.The DRC's Ebola cases aren't related to those in hard-hit West Africa, though they come at a time when many around the continent are dealing with the same disease. The DRC joins other countries, such as Nigeria and Senegal, that the WHO has declared Ebola-free in recent weeks.This good news notwithstanding, Ebola remains a very real threat elsewhere, particularly in West Africa. And in some places, things are getting worse.That includes Mali, where the first case of Ebola came from a 2½-year-old girl who'd crossed the border. Then there was a 70-year-old grand imam who came from Guinea to Bamako, where he died on October 27, prompting authorities to try to track down hundreds who were in contact with him.U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called "the new trail of transmissions in Mali ... a cause of deep concern," announcing that WHO Director-General Dr. Margaret Chan will head to the country to assist officials there."We must smother this little fire, this little smoke before it gets out of control," Chan said. "... I am confident that, if we work together as one, we will be able to bring this outbreak under control."Six Ebola cases have been reported so far in Mali. Contrast that with Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, home to the vast majority of more than 15,000 Ebola cases and over 5,000 deaths in recent months, according to a WHO report out Friday.French President Francois Hollande plans to spend November 28-30 in that stricken region -- including a visit to Guinea, a former French colony -- to address how to combat the virus, the Elysee Palace announced Friday.France is giving more than $40 million to set up Ebola treatment centers in Guinea, as well as to send medical and related equipment to that and other West African nations.Yet that's just a fraction of what's been requested to help fight the disease. The United Nations this year launched a $1 billion campaign to fight Ebola, but so far, it has fallen well short of that goal.UN's fast-track Ebola fund falls woefully shortU.N Under-Secretary-General Kandeh Yumkella told CNN's Richard Quest on Thursday that he is "cautiously optimistic" that Ebola will be brought under control, pointing, for example, to successes containing the disease in Liberia and increased awareness in some of the hardest-hit areas.But he also said that "infection rates are increasing exponentially" in parts of Sierra Leone, particularly its capital of Freetown. The U.N. official said the future rests in part on what and how much the international community does to help corral the virus.Talking about Freetown, the former Sierra Leone trade minister said, "If you look at the spike in the capital, we cannot afford one minute of complacence, whether locally or internationally."Chan echoed this view Friday for all areas now battling Ebola, saying "we must maintain our vigilance" given that for all the places where the outbreak appears to be stabilizing, new cases are still popping up elsewhere.But if the international community, local leaders and the residents of Africa do their part, Ban said, there's hope that Ebola can be beaten."If we continue to accelerate our response," the U.N. leader said, "we can contain and end the outbreak by the middle of next year."CNN's Pierre Meilhan contributed to this report.</content>

        <content>(CNN) -- French authorities backed off a claim that a 22-year-old man was connected to beheadings in a recent ISIS video, a day after publicly identifying him.A spokeswoman for the Paris prosecutor's office on Thursday distanced the agency from a news release put forth by her office that identified Mickael Dos Santos as the second French national believed to be an ISIS terrorist."We stated yesterday on precise and concurring clues about his identity. We never talked about formal identity. The investigation is still ongoing," spokeswoman Agnès Thibault-Lecuivre told CNN's Laura Akhoun. She declined further comment.Dos Santos, according to the prosecutor's office, remains wanted on a October 2013 warrant as part of an investigation into French citizens who had gone to Syria to fight with ISIS.Why are so many young French turning to jihad?The announcement leaves just Maxime Hauchard, who authorities said Monday was in the video, released over the weekend, that depicts in graphic detail the beheadings of men whom ISIS militants claim were Syrian government pilots.It also shows the aftermath of another beheading in which the victim in not clearly recognizable, but that the U.S. government says was American aid worker Peter Kassig.Public Prosecutor Francois Molins described Hauchard -- who went to Syria in 2013 and visited Mauritania the previous year -- as a "self-radicalized" jihadist who traveled to the region under the guise of a humanitarian mission. He was known to French security services as far back as 2011, the prosecutor said.More barbaric ISIS videos expected after Kassig's death, analyst saysISIS foreign fighters prompt concernThe ranks of ISIS -- the extremist group calling itself the Islamic State that's taken over vast swaths of Syria and Iraq -- have swelled with volunteers coming from outside the region, including from the West.How foreign fighters are bolstering ISISIntelligence estimates indicate that more than 100 of the foreign fighters in Iraq and Syria have come from the United States. Hundreds more arrived from Europe, including more than 900 French citizens that country's government believes are involved in the jihad there. This influx has spurred concerns that some of these fighters could bring the fight back home, perhaps with attacks inside Western nations.Those worries have been heightened by the group's brutal tactics against foe and civilians alike, such as raping, enslaving and selling Iraqi women belonging to the Yazidi religious minority. Last week, a United Nations panel stated what many consider obvious: ISIS has committed war crimes and crimes against humanity in Syria.Yazidi women 'treated like cattle'The West is fighting back, with many countries -- including France -- allying with Iraq to conduct airstrikes targeting ISIS in that country. The United States has also led airstrikes going after the group in Syria.OPINION: Kassig's murder a sign of weakness from a terror group on the run</content>

        <content>Every week, Inside Africa takes its viewers on a journey across Africa, exploring the true diversity and depth of different cultures, countries and regions.(CNN) -- Joseph Mathenge hadn't planned to be at Westgate Mall in Nairobi, Kenya in September 2013, when gunmen -- now associated with Islamist terror group Al Shabaab -- infiltrated the shopping center and started shooting en masse in a blitz that resulted in 67 deaths.The Kenyan photojournalist, who last month won African Journalist of the Year at the 2014 CNN MultiChoice African Journalist Awards, was with his son, Geoff Kihote, en route to take photos at a wedding. Geoff had been diagnosed with bone cancer, and the assignment was to help pay for his treatment in India. It was at that moment that Mathenge got a call from a friend inside the mall."I happened to be in a dilemma, because a friend of mine just called," he recalls. "She was trapped in Westgate, held hostage by terrorists, and here is my son. I had to actually think about it. "It was his son who told him they had to go.When they arrived, they found chaos. People were streaming out of the mall, ducking for cover, at a time when they were trying to find a way in."There were gun shots being fired all over as we tried to look for access into the building," recalls Mathenge.Once inside, Mathenge and his son took turns taking photos and helping injured hostages. They also communicated with security and police forces to direct them around the mall."I told (my son) to be cautious and to be focused, because any minute we could be shot," says Mathenge.With security, they located the friend who'd originally called, and moved them out of the mall. At that point, they left the scene. The father and son pair spent about eight hours in the mall."We went to the car, transmitted our pictures to newsrooms, and then we went to a restaurant where we sat down and had coffee without talking to anybody. That was our way of actually settling down our minds," says Mathenge."It was important for me to take pictures, to show the world exactly what was happening, to document the moment so that future generations could know exactly what happened."The series, entitled "Images of Terror", first appeared in the Kenyan daily newspaper The Standard.Exposing corruptionMathenge was one of several African journalists honored at the awards, held in Dar el Salaam, Tanzania last month. Other winners included South African journalists Susan Comrie and Joy Summers, for TV network Carte Blanche, who uncovered corruption in a solar geyser installment scheme in South Africa's townships. Their undercover reporting won them the G-E Energy and Infrastructure Award."It's a story of big money, and promises to the poor that they were going to get hot water," says Summers."(The solar geysers) were going to save the city a huge amount of electricity. They were supposed to be locally manufactured, they were supposed to create jobs. I don't think they did any of what was supposed to happen."'Voice to the voiceless'Rashid Ibrahim, a cameraman for Kenyan network Citizen TV, won the News Impact Award for "Veiled Justice", about the rapes of very young girls within a secretive Somali clan in northern Kenya."As cameramen, we like to hide ourselves behind the lens. Sometimes, you just put on your headsets, you focus and then you let the story flow," says Ibrahim. This time, however, he says the story got to him."The child (we interviewed) was six years old. When I was looking at her, I just felt like crying," he recalls.The awards, which were launched in 1995, are a joint venture between CNN and the South Africa-based satellite television service MultiChoice Africa."You can see how the awards have expanded over time. It continues to grow from strength to strength," says Nico Meyer, CEO of MultiChoice Africa."It's actually giving voice to the voiceless."Read: Inside the 2014 CNN MultiChoice African Journalist AwardsRead: Uganda clerics: Is gay OK?</content>

        <author>By Euan McKirdy and Kathy Quiano, CNN</author>
        <content>Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- The Indonesian police continue to use a "degrading" invasive physical test to check for female recruits virginity, a Human Rights Watch (HRW) report has claimed.A manual examination is used to physically check for an intact hymen in the recruits, the report alleges.It is, according to the report, a long-standing part of the health check that women must undergo to be accepted onto the force.While the virginity test is not specifically part of the required "obstetrics and gynecology" examination that female recruits are required to undergo to gain entry to the National Police, senior female officers told the report's authors that it has long been part of the process.Virginity a requirementThe National Police website lists the health requirements for female recruits, listing virginity as one of the requirements."In addition to the other medical and physical examinations. Women who want to become policewomen are to undergo a virginity test. Policewomen must keep their virginity," the informational page states. It ends the section with a cheery "thank you" and a smiley-face emoticon.Married women are not eligible to apply for service in the police force.Police: Exams applicable to both sexesA police spokesperson told CNN that all recruits, not only female, were subject to thorough medical tests that included examination of genitalia."Overall, the medical and physical examination has two main objectives. The first one is to make sure that the candidates' health and physical condition will not harm them when admitted into police force," spokesperson Roni Sompie said."Secondly, it is to make sure that they do not possess any communicable diseases that will not allow them to perform maximally as trained police personnel," he said."As to the examination of the virginity, it is just a part of the whole medical and physical test, not intended to solely seek for the virginity condition. Or it can not be put in a perspective for the sake of finding out the virginity, instead, it is for the sake of the completeness of medical and physical examination."Sompie also said that the HRW report was incomplete because it had not sought comment from police medical authorities.'Discriminatory, cruel, degrading'HRW says they interviewed several female officers and applicants, as well as police medical and recruitment staff. They also say they spoke with a National Police commission member. The officers and recruits who had undergone the test called it "painful" and "traumatic."The report describes the test, administered by Police Medical and Health Center staff in police hospitals in the cities of Bandung, Jakarta, Padang, Pekanbaru, Makassar, and Medan, as "discriminatory, cruel (and) degrading."One recruit interviewed by HRW for the report said: "Entering the virginity test examination room was really upsetting. I feared that after they performed the test I would not be a virgin anymore. It really hurt. My friend even fainted because... it really hurt, really hurt."HRW called the test "subjective and unscientific.""The Indonesian National Police's use of 'virginity tests' is a discriminatory practice that harms and humiliates women," said Nisha Varia, associate women's rights director at Human Rights Watch in a statement."Police authorities in Jakarta need to immediately and unequivocally abolish the test, and then make certain that all police recruiting stations nationwide stop administering it."Outside condemnationWomen's rights advocates have corroborated the HRW reports' findings."Over the last 12 years, I have been visited by many police women complaining about virginity tests conducted by police department, with some of them (saying) they have suffered from trauma having conducted the test, because they felt painful and they felt ashamed of being tested. The trauma lasts even until now," Yefri Heriyani, of Padang based Women's Crisis center Nurani Perempuan, told CNN."We protest this virginity test, which is now disguised under the name 'medical and physical examination' ... Virginity tests (are) one of the forms of sexual violence, and therefore a human rights violation. We demand an end to this practice."Reform attempts insufficientAttempts to reform the physical and abolish the "archaic" test, HRW says, have failed and the use of the test still widespread.The group says virginity tests contradict internationally-agreed human rights standards. The rights organization has also cataloged similar abuses by police in several other countries including Egypt, India, and Afghanistan, and has previously spoken out against virginity tests for Indonesian schoolgirls.HRW say the report is counterproductive to the Indonesian government's aim to recruit more women to the police force."So-called virginity tests are discriminatory and a form of gender-based violence -- not a measure of women's eligibility for a career in the police," Varia said."This pernicious practice not only keeps able women out of the police, but deprives all Indonesians of a police force with the most genuinely qualified officers."Journalist Rudy Madanir contributed to this report.</content>
