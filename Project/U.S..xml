        <content>&lt;p&gt;(CNN) -- Actress Elizabeth Peña has died of natural causes after a brief illness, her manager told CNN. She was 55.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peña passed away Tuesday, Gina Rugolo said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among her many roles, Peña is known for appearing as the mother of a character played by Sofia Vergara in the ABC sitcom "Modern Family."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She's played on both the big and small screens during her more than three-decade career. She also tried her hand at directing, becoming only the fourth Latina member of the Director's Guild of America when she joined, the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other career highlights include roles in "Down and Out in Beverly Hills," "La Bamba," "Rush Hour," and "The Incredibles."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most recently, Peña appeared in the TV drama "Matador."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am stunned and heartbroken, just found out about the passing of my friend Elizabeth Peña. She was such a Life Force it's hard to believe," tweeted actor Lou Diamond Phillips, who starred in "La Bamba."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Elizabeth was not only an amazing actress, she was one of the most vibrant, wonderful people I have ever known. My prayers to her family," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peña was born in Elizabeth, New Jersey, and she graduated from New York's High School of Performing Arts in 1977.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is survived by her mother, a sister, her husband, and two children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People we've lost in 2014&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AnneClaire Stapleton contributed to this report.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

        <highlights>The Kansas City Royals clinched a spot in the World Series on Wednesday night</highlights>
        <highlights>It's the first time they've done that since 1985</highlights>
        <highlights>They're riding an 11-game win streak going into the Fall Classic</highlights>
        <date>2014-10-16T12:14:00.000+01:00</date>
        <author>By Steve Almasy, CNN</author>
        <content>&lt;p&gt;(CNN) -- From 1976 to 1985 the Kansas City Royals were awesome. They had one of the best hitters in the game. They had sharp young pitchers. They were a part of almost every October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the 1985 World Series comeback win over the St. Louis Cardinals was the Royals' last taste of glory until Wednesday, when this year's team rumbled back into the Fall Classic, sweeping the Baltimore Orioles to win the American League Championship Series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For much of the past 29 years, the Royals haven't been a baseball afterthought, they've been a non-thought, except for their loyal fans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's plenty of room on the Royals bandwagon, so if you're thinking about getting on, here are five things to consider:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They're not baseball royalty&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If asked to name one Kansas City Royal, most people would say George Brett.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time to take an AL Champs selfie with #Royals super fan, Paul Rudd! #TakeTheCrown pic.twitter.com/1nKUpmoXHD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If asked to name a current Royal, most people would be silent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But don't be too embarrassed, this is a team that doesn't have any huge stars. They don't even have many celebrity fans. We think they have one -- actor Paul Rudd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They don't make splashy news in the free agent market. They built a great team through some smart draft picks and augmented the roster through a few nifty trades. But none of the names in the lineup stands out to people who don't closely follow the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seriously, had you heard of Lorenzo Cain until October? (He was the most valuable player of the ALCS, by the way)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They can pick it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems like you can't hit a ball where the Royals ain't. On Wednesday, the Orioles smoked four balls in the first two innings right on the nose. Every one was turned into an out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The game was punctuated by a great catch by Alex Gordon, who slammed into the left-field wall just after his glove swallowed the ball.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is your souvenir #Royals poster in tomorrow's special section. What a catch! pic.twitter.com/oC6OrjdNRN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the season, a whole lot of experts said the Royals had some of the best fielders in the majors, but then they made a 104 errors, including a stretch of 35 in 35 games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far they've had far more great plays than errors (just three in eight games) in a tense and tight postseason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They believe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Royals haven't lost in the post season since 1985.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;.@GeorgeHBrett with ANOTHER priceless reaction. #WorldSeries pic.twitter.com/8xFfQ3xgXs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, that's in part because they haven't been in the playoffs since 1985 when they won the last three against the St. Louis Cardinals to win the World Series, four games to three.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But check this, they've won 11 straight games in the postseason. All eight this year, most of them of the nail-biting, gotta-get-a-clutch-hit variety. They were four runs down and six outs from being bounced out of the playoffs before it really even started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But they rallied to beat the Athletics in extra innings in a thrilling Wild Card game and dispatched the highly favored Angels with two extra-innings wins and a rare ho-hum easy "W" in the division series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They swept the Orioles in four but they only outscored them by six runs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It helps the offense to know the bullpen is going to lock it down so all they have to do is keep it close, third baseman Mike Moustakas said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This team just doesn't panic," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They just have fun&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bo knows. Former Royal Bo Jackson says the kids on this team are a joy to watch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's been a long time since I've seen professional athletes have fun and enjoy the heck out of coming to work every day," he told sports host Jim Rome this week. The lack of outward happiness could stem from the huge money that puts pressure on players to perform, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, the not-so-regally compensated Royals -- they are 18th out of 30 teams in the majors in payroll at $91 million -- don't take the field with high expectations or a lot of pressure. This team has been rebuilding and manager Ned Yost accepts stumbles that come with a youthful team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To watch them go through the last couple of years, the ups and the downs and to finally get to this point, I am very proud of them," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are due&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was about a decade ago that the Royals lost 310 games in three years. It wouldn't even be June yet and Royals fans were already ready to give up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You never knew who the Royals fans were in your office because they never had anything to brag on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's been 29 years since their team had won a playoff game, let alone go to the World Series. Sure, there are teams with longer droughts, but these Royals are the likeable and plucky underdogs who just can't seem to be bothered with losing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CNN's Jill Martin contributed to this report.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

        <content>&lt;p&gt;(CNN) -- A terminally ill basketball player in Ohio will get a chance to make her dreams come true with her first college game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lauren Hill, 19, an incoming freshman at Mount Saint Joseph University, was diagnosed with a brain tumor last year. Her diagnosis came during her final year of high school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few weeks before she found out, she'd signed up to play basketball at Mount Saint Joseph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Undeterred, she played ball in high school despite rounds of chemotherapy for her inoperable tumor, CNN affiliate WKRC reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I never gave up for a second even when I got a terminal diagnosis; never thought about sitting back and not living life anymore," she told the affiliate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, doctors told her she doesn't have much time left to live. The university asked the NCAA if it can move its season opener by two weeks to November 2, according to the affiliate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer was yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hill will join her new teammates for her first college game against Hiram College. She plans to wear her No. 22 jersey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her first college game may be her last one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors have told her she only has until December to live, the affiliate reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

        <content>&lt;p&gt;(CNN) -- The U.S. government suppressed information about chemical weapons it found in Iraq, and several servicemembers were injured by their exposure to those weapons, The New York Times is reporting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an article published late Tuesday, the newspaper says it found 17 American servicemembers and seven Iraqi police officers who were exposed to mustard or nerve agents after 2003. They were reportedly given inadequate care and told not to talk about what happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"From 2004 to 2011, American and American-trained Iraqi troops repeatedly encountered, and on at least six occasions were wounded by, chemical weapons remaining from years earlier in Saddam Hussein's rule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In all, American troops secretly reported finding roughly 5,000 chemical warheads, shells or aviation bombs, according to interviews with dozens of participants, Iraqi and American officials, and heavily redacted intelligence documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The United States had gone to war declaring it must destroy an active weapons of mass destruction program. Instead, American troops gradually found and ultimately suffered from the remnants of long-abandoned programs, built in close collaboration with the West," the newspaper reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It quoted a former Army sergeant who suffered mustard burns in 2007 and was reportedly denied hospital treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I felt more like a guinea pig than a wounded soldier," he told the Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby on Wednesday addressed the allegations at a press briefing in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked whether injured U.S. servicemembers were denied treatment, or told to keep quiet, he said he couldn't speak to "what guidance or decisions their unit commanders or medical staff may have given them at the time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added: "I just don't have that level of detail. This happened a long time ago and it was on an individual basis."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kirby estimated that about 20 U.S. servicemembers were exposed to material from chemical munitions, from around the mid-2000s to 2010 or 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Secretary's expectation is that servicemembers and their families are going to get the care and support that they need, and if they aren't, he wants to make sure that leadership address that," Kirby said about U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But this is an issue for their chains of command to deal with, leadership at all levels to deal with. There's no need for -- and I don't expect that there's going to be -- a Pentagon-level review of these particular cases," Kirby said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The newspaper suggested several reasons why the U.S. government might have wanted to suppress the chemical weapons finds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For one, in five of the six cases in which troops were wounded by chemical agents, " the munitions appeared to have been designed in the United States, manufactured in Europe and filled in chemical agent production lines built in Iraq by Western companies," the newspaper reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For another, the weapons were old -- made before 1991 -- and therefore did not back up U.S. intelligence that at the time suggested Iraq had an active weapons of mass destruction program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In case after case, participants said, analysis of these warheads and shells reaffirmed intelligence failures. First, the American government did not find what it had been looking for at the war's outset, then it failed to prepare its troops and medical corps for the aged weapons it did find," the Times reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

        <content>&lt;p&gt;Washington (CNN) -- In an unprecedented move to protect U.S. troops that might be exposed to Ebola, U.S. military commanders are being given the authority to quarantine troops for 21 days at a Defense Department facility where they will be monitored for signs of the disease and treated if they do contract the virus, a Defense Department memo explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The memo, which was obtained by CNN, spells out the details of the military's plan for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It does not reveal the location of the facility, but one U.S. official said it may be a site in the Washington, D.C. area. The quarantine will apply to troops evacuated from West Africa, if it is determined they have an elevated risk of exposure to Ebola.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are more than 500 troops in the region currently, and the Pentagon has authorized the deployment of up to 4,000 to assist in fighting the virus. Troops are not expected to treat Ebola patients, but there is an acknowledgment by the Pentagon that some could be at risk of coming into contact with the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The October 10 memo spells out precise procedures for monitoring troops' exposure and how any problems will be dealt with. During the entire time troops are in West Africa, they may be monitored for fever or any symptoms of Ebola. If a service member comes into contact with blood or body fluids from an Ebola patient, or a dead body, while not wearing protective gear, or if the gear is compromised, they will be evacuated from the region and quarantined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you on the front lines fighting Ebola?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commanders also will be given the authority to isolate their entire unit in the region for the final 10 days of a deployment if necessary. All troops will be monitored for 21 days after returning from the mission, the memo says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

        <highlights>But U.S. is country best equipped to tackle nightmare problems of Ebola, he says</highlights>
        <highlights>Important that U.S. help beat the disease in West Africa to ease threat to U.S., Rubio says</highlights>
        <date>2014-10-16T04:07:00.000+01:00</date>
        <author>By Marco Rubio</author>
        <content>&lt;p&gt;Editor's note: Sen. Marco Rubio, a Republican from Florida, is a member of the Senate Foreign Relations and Intelligence committees. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(CNN) -- Today's world is more interconnected than ever, making the transmission of communicable diseases that originate abroad easier to reach our shores. And the ongoing Ebola outbreak is simply the latest unsettling reminder that all the benefits of an interconnected world also come with significant risks that must be addressed and mitigated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Ebola outbreak likely began with a 2-year-old in the rain forest of Guéckédou, Guinea, and it has now reached halfway around the world to Dallas, Texas, where this terrible disease claimed its first victim in the United States, Thomas Eric Duncan, last Wednesday. We have the ability to prevent a significant outbreak of the virus here in the United States, but President Obama must act much more quickly and effectively if we are going to combat the disease at its source, and thus hinder further overseas transmission and ultimately prevent the spread of the disease outside Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This challenge will only be made more difficult because many Americans lack confidence in our government's ability to effectively confront crises like this one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beginning with the first case in Guinea last December, the response to the Ebola outbreak by the international community has been slow and inadequate. Local health systems, which were weak at best, have been completely devastated as many health workers became victims of this deadly virus. The United States initially stood back and allowed the global response to be led by the World Health Organization, which failed to combat Ebola in its earliest stages. As a result, Ebola ballooned from a local problem to a regional problem, and now to a global problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States is the country best equipped with the resources and power to tackle the medical and logistical nightmare that the Ebola epidemic has become. With over 8,000 people infected, more than 4,000 dead and infection rates increasing, this outbreak of Ebola is not going to go away quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet while we need a more effective and rapid response to contain the outbreak in West Africa, we also need to make sure sufficient safeguards are in place to protect Americans. We have to make sure that every aspect of our federal government's response -- from our passenger screening efforts to our public health system -- is effectively prepared to prevent the spread of Ebola.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To that end, the United States must take several steps to strengthen our response to this challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, Americans need to have some reassurance that someone in our country is in charge of confronting this epidemic and keeping Americans safe from it. So far, inexcusably, this has not really happened. President Obama should publicly designate a senior government official to lead a task force. This person would be in charge of coordinating the U.S. response to this crisis, both domestically and internationally, including our military presence, which in a limited amount of time has already had a real impact on the ground in Liberia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, we need to target the problem at the source. Containing the outbreak in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone is the right thing to do for humanitarian reasons, but it's also essential to protecting the American people. The longer the outbreak lasts in those countries, the greater the chance of the disease being transmitted to other countries, including the United States. As part of the response abroad, we need to bolster public health systems in the region to help prevent the virus from expanding across more borders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third, we need to prevent the growing crisis in West Africa from leading to more cases in the United States. The recent announcement of increased entry screening of those traveling from affected countries by Customs and Border Patrol at select points of entry in the United States is a good but, frankly, overdue first step. However, it will not be enough, and the State Department should institute a temporary ban on new visas to non-U.S. nationals seeking to travel to the United States from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since March 1, 2014, over 6,000 visas have been issued to nationals of these countries. Foreign health workers coming to the United States to be trained should be exempted, provided they pass screening efforts. However, until we have a better handle on the problem, we need to prevent mass travel from the countries most affected. We should also ensure that Customs and Border Patrol agents at airports beyond the current transit points have the equipment and training to deal with potential cases. And additional travel restrictions should not be ruled out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fourth, the infection of two health care workers in Dallas during the treatment of Duncan raises questions about the ability of hospitals across the country to handle the extensive safety protocols required to treat Ebola patients. Two medical facilities in the United States have already successfully treated patients that have now been cured and two others have specialized facilities for treating patients with the virus. We should consider centralizing all future cases at these medical facilities, but hospitals across the United States will still need to focus on screening and isolating suspected cases that may arrive at their facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, we need to increase our efforts to develop an Ebola vaccine and to increase production of antiviral drugs. There are a few promising drugs to fight Ebola in test phases. We should speed up testing of these drugs and explore the possibility of scaling up drug manufacturing at the same time as clinical testing. Once we develop a drug with proven success, we should be ready to supply it in large numbers. In order to avoid bureaucratic red tape, we should begin discussion with the WHO, drug companies and West African governments on the processes for purchasing and distributing of these drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ebola epidemic is a reminder of the evolving nature of our national security challenges. A sick child in Africa has advanced into a global health security issue that is now knocking on America's door.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can successfully address this problem, protect our people and once again demonstrate America's compassion abroad. But much more needs to be done and it needs to happen quickly. Like other national security challenges, the longer we wait to engage, the more limited our options will become and the likelihood of success will be reduced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read CNNOpinion's new Flipboard magazine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

        <date>2014-10-15T15:42:00.000+01:00</date>
        <author>By Ed Lavandera, CNN</author>
        <content>&lt;p&gt;Hailey, Idaho (CNN) -- In the days after Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl was released from nearly five years in captivity, yellow ribbons and banners celebrating his release decorated the main street, red-bricked storefronts of his hometown. A sense of relief and excitement filled the air: Bergdahl would soon be home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But more than four months after Bergdahl returned to the United States, the ribbons and banners are gone. This town's relationship with the saga of their homegrown prisoner of war is complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're done. We're over it," Hailey Mayor Fritz Haemmerle said as he denied CNN's request for an on-camera interview. "We stood by the Bergdahl family to get Bowe home but we need to move on."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inside a secure locker of the Hailey Police Department, there are boxes filled with thousands of letters for Bergdahl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The letters were sent to the White House as part of a "Bring Bowe Home" campaign started through social media last November, just months before Bergdahl would be released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stefanie O'Neill, a Bergdahl family friend, spearheaded the letter campaign. In three months, O'Neill said, several hundred thousand letters poured into the White House. A few of those boxes were eventually shipped to Idaho. O'Neill can't bring herself to throw the letters away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It means that people all over the world cared about Bowe," O'Neill said. "We would hope that he would like to read through them one day to see just how much he meant to so many people."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The boxes are a symbol of how the story of Bergdahl's rescue didn't come with a triumphant homecoming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bergdahl's release on May 30 was instantly doused in controversy. Many of the soldiers who served with him accused the 28-year-old soldier of deserting his unit by walking off the Afghanistan base before he was captured. There was also intense criticism of the Obama administration for trading Bergdahl for five Taliban prisoners held in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bergdahl now sits in a sort of limbo. He has completed the Army's formal reintegration program and continues psychological treatment. He is still assigned to a unit with U.S. Army North in San Antonio, performing "administrative duties."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Bergdahl is also waiting to hear if he'll face any criminal charges in the military justice system. In August, he was questioned by Gen. Kenneth Dahl for two days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Army announced on Friday that Dahl completed the initial report on his findings in the Bergdahl case. The report will now be reviewed by the director of the Army staff and senior Army leaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This will be a lengthy process," an Army spokesman wrote. "It would be inappropriate to speculate on the potential results or the amount of time the review process will take to complete."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When news of Bergdahl's release broke, his family and friends had hoped for a quick reunion. For nearly five years, the lives of Bergdahl's parents had been consumed by the plight of their son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His father, Bob Bergdahl, has said he kept his clocks set to the time in Afghanistan. He grew a beard, to the dismay of many critics, to show solidarity with his son. Bob Bergdahl also taught himself Pashto, the language of his son's captors, to communicate directly with the Taliban.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the days after his son's release, critics used those details to accuse Bob Bergdahl of sympathizing with the Taliban. Bergdahl's parents have declined all requests for interviews. Family friends say Bob Bergdahl has shaved his beard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the expected family reunion never materialized and the Bergdahl family soon stopped answering questions about why Bowe Bergdahl was refusing to see his parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources tell CNN that Bergdahl is now "communicating" with his parents, but a face-to-face reunion still has not occurred. The sources would not elaborate on how Bergdahl is communicating with his family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Military officials have said Bergdahl has been given every opportunity to reunite with his family. Bergdahl's attorney, Eugene Fidell, declined to talk about Bergdahl's communication with his family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bergdahl grew up among a tight-knit community of families in Hailey that home-schooled their children. Tim Kemery's son was one of Bowe's best friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kemery said Bowe Bergdahl was raised in an intensely religious atmosphere with a strict code of conduct. Around age 16, Kemery said, Bergdahl left home and embarked on a series of adventures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No doubt it was some kind of rebellion," Kemery said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Kemery couldn't say if that childhood rebellion was still a source of tension between Bergdahl and his family. He said he also wonders why the soldier hasn't reunited with his parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There may have been something there that was a bone of contention," said Kemery. "Maybe it's the debriefing (reintegration process) or because he feels like he has let them down or for some other unknown reason he just doesn't want to have that emotional recognition again of his parents."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kemery said that as a child Bergdahl struggled to control his frustration and would often disappear for days at a time, building forts and hiking for miles into the Idaho wilderness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kemery said he sees a parallel between the young Bowe he knew and the soldier accused by fellow soldiers of walking off his military base in Afghanistan in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Bowe did have a tendency to get really frustrated and just to walk off and throw up his hands," said Kemery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around Hailey, one often hears people asking the same question, will Bowe Bergdahl ever come back home? Bergdahl must wait to hear what military commanders will determine about his fate. Will he be charged with a crime? Will he be discharged?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bergdahl's lawyer has said the soldier would like to continue his education. Tim Kemery hopes he makes time to visit Idaho.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have a hunting trip waiting for him. We are going to talk about things around the fire," said Kemery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CNN's Jason Morris contributed to this report.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

        <author>By Ray Sanchez, CNN</author>
        <content>&lt;p&gt;(CNN) -- "I killed that lady," the 10-year-old boy told a Pennsylvania state trooper, after a 90-year-old woman was found dead in the home of the boy's grandfather.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tristen Kurilla, a fifth grader, made the chilling confession Saturday, police said, after his mother brought him to the Pennsylvania State Police Barracks in Honesdale, about 140 miles north of Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, Kurilla is being held at the Wayne County Correctional Facility and charged as an adult with criminal homicide, the Wayne County district attorney's office said. The boy is separated from adult offenders and is being constantly supervised, CNN affiliate WBRE reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The boy admitted to grabbing a wooden cane, holding it against 90-year-old Helen Novak's throat for several seconds and punching her in the throat and stomach, according to the police affidavit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kurilla told police he was angry at Novak because she had yelled at him when he entered her room. He said he wanted to ask her a question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Were you trying to kill her? the trooper asked the boy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No, I was only trying to hurt her," Kurilla replied, according to the affidavit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The boy was ordered to be held without bail after his arraignment and is set to appear in court October 22.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bernie Brown, his lawyer, said he was petitioning the court to get the fifth-grade Damascus Elementary School student out of jail, WBRE reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Tristen really kind of doesn't have an idea of what is going on," Brown told the station.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brown added, "Jail is still jail, no matter what part of the facility you are in."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brown also can petition a judge to transfer the case to juvenile court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Janine Edwards, Wayne County district attorney, said Pennsylvania law made it mandatory "that a criminal homicide charge be first directly filed in adult court by the prosecutor regardless of the age of the perpetrator," WBRE reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is not a choice I made," she told the station, adding that a juvenile detention center will not accept a child charged with homicide. "It's not a choice the warden made. It's not a choice Pennsylvania State Police made."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The age of the defendant was unusual, she told the station.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's not something I've seen," she said. "I'm not sure how many times that's been seen in Pennsylvania or not."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police were initially called to the home of Kurilla's grandfather, Anthony Virbitsky, in Damascus Township on Saturday morning with a report that an elderly woman had died there, the affidavit said. Virbitsky was the woman's caretaker, authorities said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The county coroner responded to the home, found Novak's body and transported it to the morgue, the affidavit stated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few hours later, the boy's mother, Martha Virbitsky, appeared at the state police post with her son and told Trooper John Decker that the boy had confessed to killing Novak, the affidavit said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The boy's mother told police that she "has had a lot of trouble with Tristen and that he has some mental difficulties" and had been violent in the past, the affidavit said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kurilla had told his grandfather that Novak was bleeding from the mouth, but denied having done anything to her, Decker wrote in the affidavit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthony Virbitsky told police he checked on Novak but found no blood, although she was breathing heavily. He asked her if she wanted to go to a hospital, the affidavit said, but she refused. When he went to check on her less than an hour later, she was dead, Virbitsky told police, and then his grandson confessed that he had hit her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An autopsy performed Monday discovered "blunt force trauma to Novak's neck" and her death was ruled a homicide, the district attorney's statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some residents in Damascus Township took issue with locking up the boy in the county jail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I know they see a lot of things but I don't think that they understand what they're doing," Kristy Tirney told WBRE. "I don't know."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>
