        <content>Kano, Nigeria (CNN) -- Several people were injured when a suicide bomber blew himself up outside a church in the northeastern Nigerian city of Gombe on New Year's Day, residents and a rescue worker said.It came only hours after a female suicide bomber was killed outside the Bolari military barracks, also in Gombe, on New Year's Eve, witnesses said.The male bomber, who was on a motorcycle, struck outside an evangelical church in the Tudun Wada area of the city at about 9 a.m. local time, as worshipers attended a New Year service.The explosives strapped to his body detonated as he was having a heated argument with church volunteers who had set up a barricade some distance from the church to screen people and prevent any attack by the Islamist militant group Boko Haram, according to Samson Luka, an eyewitness."Some people nearby were injured from the blast but none of the injuries are life-threatening," Luka said.A Nigerian Red Cross official in the city confirmed an "explosion by a suicide bomber" outside the church in which some worshipers were hurt.The botched bombing was the first violence this year to hit a region that has been wracked by a five-year deadly uprising by Boko Haram militants.The explosion terrified residents, who rushed from their homes into the street in fear."The moment I heard the huge blast my mind told me it was a bomb and I dashed out of my house only to learn it was from a suicide bomber outside the church," said resident Hauwa Ahmed.There was no immediate comment from authorities on the blast.In the incident Wednesday evening, soldiers opened fire on the woman when she refused to stop for a search, triggering an explosion of the suicide belt she was wearing under her veil, according to witnesses.The woman ignored orders by soldiers on guard at the gates of the military barracks â€Žto stop at a distance for screening and instead strode toward them, said resident Adamu Kuntau, in an account supported by other residents."The soldiers opened fire on the woman and the suicide belt concealed under her hijab exploded, killing her," Kuntau said.Security at the barracks has been reinforced since last June, when a female suicide bomber blew herself up when she was stopped outside the barracks for screening, killing one soldier and injuring another.</content>

        <content>(CNN) -- The United States conducted an airstrike Monday in Somalia against Al-Shabaab, said Navy Rear Adm. John Kirby, Pentagon press secretary.The strike, which took place in the area of Saakow, was targeting a senior leader of the Islamist militant group."At this time, we do not assess there to be any civilian or bystander casualties. We are assessing the results of the operation and will provide additional information, when appropriate, as details become available," Kirby said in a statement.The strike was carried out by an unmanned aircraft, and was an operation of the U.S. Defense Department, according to a U.S. defense official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.On Saturday, Somalia government forces captured a top Al-Shabaab commander, said two of the country's military officials.Zakariya Ismail Ahmed Hersi, Al-Shabaab's intelligence chief, was captured in a house near the town of El Wak, Somali military commander Isack Hussein Mursal told state-run radio.He was a close associate of former Al-Shabaab leader Ahmed Abdi Godane, who was killed in a U.S. airstrike near Barawe city in September.The capture came after militants with the group, which is linked to al Qaeda, attacked a large African Union base in Mogadishu last week, killing three Ugandan soldiers and a civilian.Al-Shabaab has said that attack was revenge for the U.S. airstrike that killed Godane. The State Department had offered a $7 million reward for information on Godane's location.CNN's Omar Nor and Susanna Capelouto contributed to this report.</content>

        <content>(CNN) -- At least 23 people were killed in a Boko Haram attack in the Mozogo district in Cameroon's Far North Region, an official said.The regional governor, Mijiyawa Bakary, confirmed the attack by the Nigeria-based Islamist militants, but did not give further details."We are still gathering the facts from our divisional officers, but what we know for now is that the attackers killed at least 23 people. The damage could be more," he said.The attackers also burned down a village, security forces told CNN.A soldier on the front who did not want to be named told CNN by phone that the insurgents carried out a similar attack along the Waza-Mora highway on Friday, killing one Cameroonian soldier.The soldier said "a corporal was killed and three soldiers were wounded. The attackers also confiscated a (Toyota) Land Cruiser belonging to the Cameroon military."Earlier this month, the country's state-run broadcaster CRTV reported that 116 Boko Haram fighters and one Cameroonian soldier were killed during an attack that the militant group launched against a military column in northern Cameroon.And in May, Boko Haram militants kidnapped 10 Chinese road construction workers in Waza, just miles from the border with Nigeria, and killed one worker. The hostages were freed in October.Boko Haram has terrorized northern Nigeria regularly since 2009, attacking police, schools, churches and civilians, and bombing government buildings.The Islamist group -- considered one of the world's most deadly terrorist organizations -- has said its aim is to impose a stricter enforcement of sharia law across Nigeria, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south.Increasingly, it has crossed into northern Cameroon, attacking military forces, as well as kidnapping foreign nationals. But there is no firm evidence the group has ambitions beyond Nigeria.CNN's Tim Lister and journalist Ngala Killian Chimtom contributed to this report.</content>

        <author>By Faith Karimi and Chelsea J. Carter, CNN</author>
        <content>(CNN) -- Boko Haram's escalating danger is indisputable.The militant group has bombed schools, churches and mosques; kidnapped women and children; and assassinated politicians and religious leaders alike.This week, the group kidnapped at least 185 women and children and killed 32 in a raid on the village of Gumsuri in northeastern Nigeria. Militants shot down men and threw petrol bombs before herding women and children together and taking them away in trucks, a local government official said. One survivor reported militants had "destroyed almost half the village."In April, gunmen abducted more than 200 girls in the town of Chibok, a short distance south of Gumsuri. After a fierce gunbattle with soldiers, the militants herded the girls out of bed and onto buses, and sped off. Only a few dozen of the girls have escaped.What exactly is Boko Haram, and why has it turned into a Nigerian synonym for fear and bloodshed?What does 'Boko Haram' mean?The name translates to "Western education is sin" in the local Hausa language.The militant group says its aim is to impose a stricter enforcement of Sharia law across Africa's most populous nation, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south.In recent years, its attacks have intensified in an apparent show of defiance amid the nation's military onslaught. Its ambitions appear to have expanded to the destruction of the Nigerian government.How long has it been around?The group was founded 12 years ago by Mohammed Yusuf, a charismatic cleric who called for a pure Islamic state in Nigeria. Police killed him in 2009 in an incident captured on video and posted to the Internet.The crackdown, some say, made Boko Haram more violent and defiant.Abubakar Shekau took control of the group and escalated the attacks. It murdered and kidnapped Westerners, and started a bombing campaign that targeted churches, mosques and government buildings.Why not just kill Abubakar Shekau?One word: elusive.Questions have swirled about Shekau, including whether he's dead or alive. Even his age is unknown -- estimates range between 35 and 44.In recent years, the Nigerian military has touted his death, only to retract its claim after he appeared alive and vibrant in propaganda videos.He uses the alias Darul Tawheed, and analysts describe him as a ruthless loner and master of disguise. He does not speak directly with members, opting to communicate through a few select confidants.Why would an Islamist militant group target the Muslim north?Despite its religious fanaticism, Boko Haram does not consider all Muslims as supporters and allies.There have been suggestions that it attacks certain mosques because members have spoken out against it and helped federal officials with their crackdown. Its attacks are aimed at striking fear at the heart of the local population to prevent cooperation with the government, analysts say.Does the north support the group?Although the northern populace mostly abhors the violence, there is considerable local sympathy and support for Sharia law, seen by many as the only way to end what is widely regarded as a corrupt and inept government. Poverty is prevalent in the northern region, and as the military struggles to halt Boko Haram's attacks, the militant group is winning perhaps its most important battle: making Nigerians question government competency.Rights groups have accused local authorities of human rights violations in the fight against the group, adding to the anti-government sentiment.What's the West doing to help?The United States has put a $7 million bounty on Shekau's head. It also designated Boko Haram as a foreign terrorist network last year. Though it has provided technical and financial support to the Nigerian teams battling the insurgency, there has been a reluctance to put boots on the ground unless there's a direct national security threat to the West. Boko Haram's attacks have been limited primarily to Nigeria.I don't live in Nigeria, so why should I care?With a population of 175 million, Nigeria is Africa's most populous nation and is considered a political and economic powerhouse in the continent. The key U.S. partner is rich in oil, a major trading partner with China, and is the hub of global business in the region.And as we've learned with Mali, any unresolved local Islamist insurgency has the potential of spiraling into a world problem.Last year, Shekau released a statement vowing to attack the United States and Europe."Our strength and firepower is bigger than that of Nigeria. Nigeria is no longer a big deal to us, as far as we are concerned. We will now comfortably confront the United States of America," he said.Does it have ties to al Qaeda?The U.S. says Boko Haram has links to the al Qaeda affiliate in West Africa and to extremist groups in Mali.What other attacks has the group conducted?In April, a massive explosion ripped through a bus station in the Nigerian capital, killing at least 71 people. In a video, Shekau said the group was behind the attack.In November, the group abducted dozens of Christian women, most of whom were later rescued by the military. Some were pregnant or had children, and others had been forcibly converted to Islam and married off to their kidnappers.In 2011, a Boko Haram suicide attack on the United Nations building in Abuja killed at least 25 people.Boko Haram: The essence of terror</content>

        <content>(CNN) -- Al-Shabaab said it attacked an African Union military base in Somalia on Thursday in retaliation for a U.S. airstrike that killed their leader near Barawe in September."Al-Shabaab has carried out the AU military base attack to revenge the killing of our leader, Ahmed Godane," the group's spokesman Ali Dheere said on Andalus radio,a pro-Al-Shabaab broadcaster, Friday.Seven Al-Shabaab militants are dead after they attacked Somalia's largest base for African Union troops, according to the African Union Mission in Somalia.Two militants in a car detonated themselves inside the Halane Military base in Mogadishu, AMISOM spokesman Ali Aden Houmed said.Three AU soldiers from Uganda and a civilian died in the attack, AMISOM said on its website. Seven Al-Shabab soldiers were killed, AU said.The heavily fortified base also houses several U.N. and international agencies."I condemn this reprehensible attack on the AMISOM base camp in Mogadishu which also hosts the UN Headquarters for Somalia," U.N. Special Envoy for Somalia Nicholas Kay said.He praised the quick response of AU forces to the attack.Maman S. Sidikou, special representative of the AU Commission chairperson (SRCC) for Somalia and head of AMISOM, offered his condolences to the families of the victims and "applauded the quick response and bravery of the ... troops in quelling this reprehensible attack," according to AMISOM.Al-Shabaab has been waging war in Somalia in an effort to implement a stricter form of Islamic law, or sharia.Established in 2007, the U.N.-backed AMISOM currently has some 20,000 African Union troops deployed in the impoverished nation to "conduct peace support operations" and to "stabilize the situation."What is Al-Shabaab and what does it want?</content>

        <content>Kano, Nigeria (CNN) -- A 13-year-old Nigerian girl told reporters that her father handed her over to Islamist militants to become a suicide bomber, but she fled as two other girls detonated their explosives at a market earlier this month.The girl was presented before the media Wednesday to describe what she called her forced role in the deadly attack. Her father, she said, joined Boko Haram and took his wife and daughter to a village in the forest in Bauchi state in northern Nigeria."My father took us to the bush, which was surrounded by gunmen," she said, according to a CNN translation. "I was asked if I wanted to go to heaven. When I answered, they said I have to go for a suicide mission and if I attempted to run they would kill me."The girl and two others were taken by Boko Haram militants to Nigeria's second most populous city, Kano, and were dressed with explosives-laden devices.The other girls set off hidden bombs that day, killing four people, police said."One of the girls said one of us should enter the market first," the girl told reporters. "She said we should separate when we entered the market."The girl described how one attacker said the third girl would set off her bomb first, then the remaining two would detonate their explosives."I said no. I said I would not detonate," the girl said.She was wounded by one of the explosions.The teen escaped in a rickshaw that she took to a former home in Kano, the girl said. Neighbors saw her and made her go to a hospital. She left the explosive device in the cart, but the driver and hospital officials recognized the device and alerted authorities.The girl told police she was forced into being a part of the attack.What to know about Boko HaramCNN has not independently verified the girl's story. Police presented her to the media without her parents or a lawyer present. Officials wanted to make clear the attack was the work of Boko Haram."We want to disabuse the minds of members of the public. ... This is not a tribal war. It's a terrorism act like we have had in the past," Kano State Police Commissioner Adenerele Shinabad said.Boko Haram has terrorized northern Nigeria regularly since 2009, attacking police, schools, churches and civilians, and bombing government buildings. Violence has increased sharply in recent months, just ahead of Nigeria's February elections.Schoolgirl describes escape from Boko HaramThe group has targeted mainstream Islam, saying that it does not represent the interests of Nigeria's 80 million Muslims and that it perverts Islam.In April, Boko Haram militants drew international condemnation when they kidnapped more than 200 schoolgirls, many of whom they said they sold into slavery.At least 5,000 people have died at Boko Haram's hands, according to a U.S. Congressional Research Service report, making it one of the world's deadliest terrorist organizations.Why outrage alone will not defeat Boko Haram and #BringBackOurGirlsCNN's Aminu Abubakr reported from Kano and Steve Almasy wrote in Atlanta. CNN's Jessica King contributed to this report.</content>

        <author>By Lillian Leposo, CNN</author>
        <content>Abuja, Nigeria (CNN) -- Samuel Yaga, a mechanic, was making a routine repair on a client's car when his phone rang. It was a phone call that would change his life forever."I was called in the morning by my elder brother notifying me of an attack on the school where my daughter was schooling," he said.Samuel's blood went cold as his brother continued, telling him that some of the girls had been abducted by Boko Haram.Samuel knew only too well the vicious and brutal nature of the terrorist group: just a few months before this, Boko Haram had attacked his village in northeastern Nigeria.Armed men forced him out of his house and one of them pointed a gun to his head. By a sheer miracle, unexplainable even to Samuel, one of the militants intervened, and his life was spared.Their entire village was razed to the ground and so Samuel moved his family to Chibok and enrolled his eldest daughter Sarah into the Government Secondary School so that she could sit for her final high school exam.He chose Chibok because not only was it his ancestral home and he had relatives there but also because it had no history of Boko Haram attacks. He felt it was safe -- until now.Later in the day Samuel's brother phoned him again. "Then before sunset he called me again, and informed me that my daughter was part of those that were taken by Boko Haram."His wife Rebecca says the news of her daughter's abduction tore at her heart. She refused to believe it when her husband first told it to her -- until it was confirmed on the evening news."Seriously, seriously, mum and her daughter. The pain is indescribable," she reflects.Rebecca says there is not a day that goes by that she does think of her daughter. She describes her daughter as an ambitious girl who saw education as a way out of poverty."She used to tell me one day she will finish school and become somebody. She used to assist the younger ones with their homework," she said"She loved studies. She used to fall asleep with her books in her arms," she added.Her father remembers her as the caring eldest child who used to secretly collect his dirty clothes, wash them and press them for him. He also remembers her passion for knowledge."She is brilliant. She liked reading. Always she loved going to school," he said.Inside their small one roomed house -- there is nothing to indicate that the Christmas festive season has begun. They say Christmas used to be a time of laughter and spending time with family."Every Christmas we used to be complete and happy but now one of us is not there, how can it be the same?" asks Samuel."There is nothing I can say. It has happened. It is a bad Christmas. But there is nothing we can do," says Rebecca.A sadness surrounds the couple as they clutch to the only physical memory that they have of their daughter -- a few photos and one bright green top, one of her favorites.But although they are at low spirits, they say their hopes remain high that their daughter will come back. They pass on that encouragement to their other five children who say they miss their sister."Her siblings know that she is not here -- they themselves know what is happening, having come out of war," says Samuel."They keep asking me, 'When is she coming back?' But I keep telling them to keep trusting God. Maybe He will hear us," he adds.</content>

        <content>(CNN) -- Another Hollywood movie is running afoul of a foreign government this month."Exodus: Gods and Kings" was banned in Egypt."The Ministry of Culture bans the film 'Gods and Kings' for historical inaccuracies," the Egyptian agency said in a statement.The movie, which stars Christian Bale as Moses, is a re-enactment of the biblical story of the Jews' escape from slavery in Egypt more than 3,000 years ago, during the time of the pharaohs. Australian actor Joel Hedgerton plays the Pharaoh Ramses in the 20th Century Fox production.Egyptian Culture Minister Jabir Asfour slammed the film as "Zionist.""It shows history from a Zionist viewpoint and forges historical events, therefore it is was banned in Egypt," according to state news agency EGYNews.In 1956, the same biblical story was told in "The Ten Commandments" starring Charlton Heston as Moses and Yul Brynner as Ramses. That version was filmed on location in Egypt."Exodus" is the latest in Hollywood's string of religious-themed movies released this year.In March, several Muslim countries banned the blockbuster "Noah," saying the depiction of Noah -- whom Muslims revere as a prophet -- is forbidden in Islam.News of the ban comes on the heels of the limited release of "The Interview," the movie that provoked North Korea to vow "merciless" action against the United States over its lampooning of leader Kim Jong Un. On Saturday, North Korea called U.S. President Barack Obama the "chief culprit" who forced Sony to "indiscriminately distribute" the picture.Margot Haddad contributed to this story</content>

        <content>Editor's note: In a series of articles, CNN journalists are sharing stories of deaths in 2014 that affected them personally. To share your story, please visit CNN iReport.(CNN) -- In Portugal and in particular for supporters of Benfica football club, the name of Eusebio da Silva Ferreira is synonymous with greatness.Even though my generation never actually saw him play, we were able to access plenty of archive footage in which he showcased his skill on the pitch.But the real insight came from generations before me, like my parents or grandparents. Through them, I was able to learn about the man and athlete known to the world as "A Pantera Negra" (The Black Panther).Those stories still resonate till this day almost like fairy tales.The young kid who ended up traveling almost 5,000 miles to pursue his passion for soccer and ended up with a lot more than he bargained for. The teen striker moved to Portugal at the age of 18, after a former Brazilian footballer working at the time as a scout, told Benfica's manager BÃ©la Guttmann about his promising talents.Since joining the team in 1960 up until 1975, Eusebio won 11 league titles, one European Cup, five Portuguese cups, among several other team and individual records.People would say he was the best player to ever grace Portugal with his talent. That the way he exploded on the pitch with his fast pace combined with the power of his right foot was a joy to watch. Adding his phenomenal stats with 733 goals, including 41 for country, it then became obvious we were talking about one of the greats.It didn't take me long to understand what people meant every time they spoke about him. A few YouTube clips could easily testify to this and go as far as to reveal that such attributes would still make him a star, even in today's game.His success on the pitch, however, took on massive proportions, as it was not a mere sporting achievement. It was proof that Portugal was able to produce great talent and conquer new and different horizons. It gave people hope, happiness and some comfort, which was all much needed at the time.During the period when Eusebio burst onto the scene, Portugal was going through a rough stage under the decades-long dictatorship of Antonio Salazar. Only what was known as the "three F's:" Fado, Football and Fatima (the Virgin Mary) would cheer the masses.So the level of success that Portugal enjoyed under the leadership of Eusebio was crucial as a distraction that kept the population together. It is therefore no surprise that many people from all over the country admired Eusebio, regardless of the club they supported.As years went by and my passion for the game of soccer grew stronger, the "King's" (his other nickname) life and career became even more appealing to me.I can't deny that a big part of it has to do with my allegiance to Benfica, the club for which the Mozambique-born Portuguese footballer played 15 out of his 22 years as a professional athlete. It was obvious that this love affair would continue after his career ended. After retiring, he was offered a role as an ambassador, which he played until his last breath. Equally, he also acted worldwide as a spokesperson for the game.The part seemed fitting for a man of his skills. More than just making use of his legendary status, as a man he was known for being a humble, kind and tremendously charismatic, making him very popular across the country as well as beyond our own borders.It is then no surprise that, on January 5th, the world reacted with shock to the news of his passing at the age of 71.Soon after, I was called by CNN to travel to Lisbon in order to cover the story. I remember having mixed feelings at the time. On one hand I was saddened by the news, but on the other hand I felt incredibly privileged to have the opportunity to cover the story by attending his funeral from a journalistic standpoint. This had a very special meaning, as it allowed me to also pay my respects as a long-time admirer.I was able to witness how his death brought the country closer together. It was beautiful to see the amount of people that followed the coffin or showed up at the church. The crowds assembling close to his statue at the Stadium of Light, statue which by the way was covered from head to toe with flowers and scarves from various Portuguese clubs, as a sign of admiration.You could say that on that day, even the biggest soccer fanatic was colour-blind. There was no Benfica, Sporting or Porto -- there was only a unified country!At a time when Portugal is facing a long, hard financial depression -- which has not only affected our country's economy, but also our spirits -- it was remarkable to see that, even if just for a few days, fans -- including longtime rivals -- were paying homage to a man they've learned to respect and admire for his talent and flair, but also for his personality.His name is still very much present in the culture of not only the club, but the country. Being such a timeless character, I can only wait for the time where I tell my kids the same stories I was told growing up. It is an ongoing way of celebrating his life.Read more: People we lost: Benjamin Bradlee and Lorin Maazel, by Christiane AmanpourRead more: People we lost: Phil Everly, by Jonathan HawkinsRead more: People we lost: Joe Cocker, by Neil CurryRead more: People we lost: Christophe de Margerie, by John DefteriosRead more: Loved ones we lost in 2014</content>

        <author>By Jennifer Z. Deaton and Jason Hanna, CNN</author>
        <content>(CNN) -- The Algerian military has killed the leader of an Algerian terror group that beheaded French hiker Herve Gourdel earlier this year, the state-run Algeria Press Service reported Tuesday.Gouri Abdelmalek, leader of Jund al Khilafa, and two other militants were killed in the Algerian city of Isser after the military set an unspecified "trap," for them, APS reported Tuesday, citing Algeria's defense ministry.The report of Abdelmalek's death comes roughly three months after Jund al Khilafa -- a small Islamist group formerly linked to al Qaeda -- published a video showing the beheading of Gourdel in what the group said was a display of support to al Qaeda's rival ISIS.Gourdel, 55, was hiking in central Algeria's Djudjura National Park when he was abducted in September. Jund al Khilafa, having just declared allegiance to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), then published a video of Gourdel's beheading on September 24.The video was titled, "A message of blood for the French government." The group said it was responding to an appeal by ISIS spokesman Muhammad al-Adnani to kill "the spiteful and filthy French" because of their support for military action against the group in Iraq.A video message showing the execution was designed to resemble beheadings carried out by ISIS, as were the words of one of the militants, who said: "Let the French people know that their blood is cheap for their President, and it is the same as you made the blood of the Muslim women and children cheap in Iraq and Sham (Syria)."The Algerian government called the beheading an act of "criminals," and French President Francois Hollande said at the time that Algeria's Prime Minister assured him he would do the utmost to find the killers.On Monday, the Algerian army launched its attack in Isser after tracking what it believed was "a dangerous terrorist group driving a vehicle" in the city, the Algerian defense ministry said, according to APS. Abdelmalek was later confirmed as one of the three that the army killed, APS reported Tuesday.Jund al Khilafa, which means "Soldiers of the Caliphate," had been a part of al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. Abdelmalek, who was the commander of AQIM's central region, said in September that his fighters were abandoning AQIM because of "the certain deviation of the methods of the mother organization al-Qaeda, and that of the Islamic Maghreb."Abdelmalek had been active in a militant Islamist insurgency in Algeria for 14 years.Gourdel was just one of the Westerners to be beheaded by an Islamist extremist group this year. Since mid-August, ISIS has beheaded American journalists Steven Sotloff and James Foley, British aid worker David Haines, British aid convoy volunteer Alan Henning, and American aid worker Peter Kassig.CNN's Tim Lister and Steve Almasy contributed to this report.</content>
