<p>(CNN) -- Two West Virginia officers were shot and wounded Thursday in a traffic stop on Interstate 64 that led to the discovery of two bodies.According to state police Lt. Michael Baylous, two police officers from the town of Lewisburg pulled over a white Chevrolet SUV with North Carolina plates after learning it had been reported stolen.As the officers were conducting the traffic stop, a red Chevrolet truck pulled alongside them and the driver "pulled a handgun and shot at both officers," Baylous said.Group: Ambush attacks on officers increasesThe drivers of both Chevrolets then fled: the red truck "went over the hillside and was eventually taken into custody," while the other motorist "drove behind a guardrail on the interstate and hid for a short amount of time," according to Baylous."Eventually, he walked up to the interstate and turned himself into law enforcement without incident."Neither driver has been named, but they informed police that they were father and son.When police searched the red truck allegedly being driven by dad, they found two "recently deceased bodies" hidden under a mattress. "It is believed that the victims are from North Carolina," Baylous said.Baylous said, "the two suspects will be arrested for malicious assault and attempted murder of a police officer."The officers -- who also have not been named -- were taken to Greenbrier Valley Medical Center. Their conditions were not immediately known Thursday night.CNN's Dave Alsup contributed to this report</p>

<p>(CNN) -- When the cops showed up to a subdivision Wednesday night in Oldsmar, Florida, it wasn't to break up a loud party or for any sort of bacchanalian revelry typical of New Year's Eve.No, Mario Gomez called 911 to report something far more sinister and ghastly: His brother had just cut off their mother's head with an ax.Responding deputies found the decapitated body of 48-year-old Maria Suarez Cassagne alongside garbage cans outside of the Tampa-area home, according to the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office. Her head was inside one of them.Gomez told the authorities that his younger brother, Christian Gomez, had fled the scene, but he didn't make it too far. The Sheriff's Office said it found the 23-year-old some 30 minutes later on a bicycle about a mile from his home and took him into custody.What could possibly lead a son to be accused of cutting off his own mother's head and then disposing of her body as if trash?The younger Gomez -- who admitted to the murder, according to the Sheriff's Office -- was apparently fed up with his mother's "nagging" over the previous two days about moving some boxes into the attic, Sheriff Bob Gualtieri told CNN.Christian Gomez, 23, has been charged with first-degree murder and is in the Pinellas County Jail. It was not known by the Sheriff's Office whether he had retained an attorney, and the Public Defender's Office was closed New Year's Day.Prosecutor to seek death penalty in Oklahoma beheading</p>

<p>(CNN) -- Former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo -- who rose from the Depression-era streets of Queens to serve three times as governor and whose passionate keynote address at the 1984 Democratic political convention vaulted him onto the national political scene -- died Thursday. He was 82.Cuomo had been hospitalized recently to treat a heart condition. His family said he passed away, at home, from "natural causes due to heart failure."Cuomo was governor for three terms, from 1983 to 1995.He was married to his wife, Matilda, for more than six decades. They had five children, including current New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who was sworn in for his second term Thursday, and Chris Cuomo, host of CNN's "New Day."Asked once how he wanted to be remembered, Mario Cuomo replied: "One of the simple things I wanted to achieve is -- I want to be governor. I want to be the hardest working there ever was. And I want, when it's over -- and I figured on four years at first -- I want people to say, now, there was an honest person."Democratic standard-bearerCuomo burst onto the national political stage with his keynote address at the 1984 Democratic National Convention.To say he was a powerful speaker would be an understatement.A Queens native, Cuomo was born in New York City, in the apartment above his father's grocery store. After a brief shot at a career in minor league baseball, he pursued a law degree and graduated at the top of his class at St. John's University School of Law.Although the allure of public service was strong, Cuomo's early attempts at seeking political office ended in defeat.His first electoral success came in 1978 as running mate to former Gov. Hugh Carey. Four years later, Carey stepped aside, and Cuomo entered the race and won.He held the governorship for three terms, winning two more handily by emphasizing lower taxes, balanced budgets, public education and affirmative action. He was a strong opponent of the death penalty.In 1993, Cuomo passed up the opportunity to be appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court, choosing instead to run for a fourth term as governor. He lost in 1994.Having fun in the face of defeat, Cuomo made a popular commercial for Doritos, which also starred Ann Richards, who lost the Texas governorship the same year.'You can now sleep with the greats'President Barack Obama praised Cuomo for his faith in God and championing of progressive values in a statement issued by the White House."His own story taught him that as Americans, we are bound together as one people, and our country's success rests on the success of all of us, not just a fortunate few," the President said.Cuomo announced Bill Clinton's nomination for President at the 1992 Democratic Convention."It was Mario Cuomo's great gift and our good fortune that he was both a sterling orator and a passionate public servant. His life was a blessing," Clinton said in a statement.Obamas praise Mario CuomoJon Favreau, a former speechwriter for President Barack Obama, praised Cuomo's 1984 address as one of his all-time favorite speeches."Used to read it constantly for inspiration," he tweeted.Cuomo's death touched people across the political spectrum."Our country and our region lost a giant today with the passing of Governor Mario Cuomo," New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said in a statement. "He was a strong, eloquent leader who loved New York and its people. As an Italian-American, he was also a role model for future generations that anything was possible through hard work and education."The Rev. Al Sharpton remembered the former governor as "the last liberal giant of New York politics.""He was a philosopher at heart that always saw the bigger picture. Even when we would engage in debate I felt he was playing chess while I was playing checkers," he said. "Mario, you have earned it and your place in history is secure. You can now sleep with the greats."New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has ordered flags flying in the city that were lowered to half staff in honor of slain NYPD officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu to remain lowered for 30 days to honor Cuomo's memory.He commended his humanity in a statement:"Mario Cuomo was a man of unwavering principle who possessed a compassion for humankind that was without equal."CNN's Wolf Blitzer and Catherine E.

<p>(CNN) -- When Josh Alcorn voiced a desire to live as a girl, the Ohio teenager's parents said they wouldn't stand for that."We don't support that, religiously," Alcorn's mother told CNN on Wednesday, her voice breaking. "But we told him that we loved him unconditionally. We loved him no matter what. I loved my son. People need to know that I loved him. He was a good kid, a good boy."Crossing out the name "Josh," the 17-year-old signed the name "Leelah" in a suicide note posted to Tumblr.The note was programmed to publish after Alcorn's death Sunday. The teenager was struck by a tractor-trailer on Interstate 71 about 2:15 a.m., about four miles from home in the tiny town of Kings Mills, northeast of Cincinnati.The Ohio State Highway Patrol is investigating the death as a suicide."Please don't be sad, it's for the better. The life I would've lived isn't worth living in ... because I'm transgender," the note said. "I could go into detail explaining why I feel that way, but this note is probably going to be lengthy enough as it is. To put it simply, I feel like a girl trapped in a boy's body, and I've felt that way ever since I was 4. I never knew there was a word for that feeling, nor was it possible for a boy to become a girl, so I never told anyone and I just continued to do traditionally 'boyish' things to try to fit in."The teenager's death has ignited intensely emotional reactions across social media. The hashtag #LeelahAlcorn is carrying messages of support for all transgender people. Many posts are hateful and vengeful notes directed at the teen's parents.In her interview with CNN, Carla Alcorn referred to her child as her son and used male pronouns.After the death, a Facebook post apparently from Carla Alcorn said her child "went home to heaven this morning. He was out for an early morning walk and was hit by a truck. Thank you for the messages and kindness and concern you have sent our way. Please continue to keep us in your thoughts."Some on social media have seized on that post and reposted her message, crossing out the male pronouns and the name Josh and replacing them with female pronouns and the name Leelah.'He just quit talking about it'In Leelah's note, she explains that when she was 14, she first understood what transgender meant and "cried of happiness.""After 10 years of confusion I finally understood who I was. I immediately told my mom, and she reacted extremely negatively, telling me that it was a phase, that I would never truly be a girl, that God doesn't make mistakes, that I am wrong. If you are reading this, parents, please don't tell this to your kids," the note says. "Even if you are Christian or are against transgender people don't ever say that to someone, especially your kid. That won't do anything but make them hate them self. That's exactly what it did to me."Carla Alcorn told CNN that her child was depressed and that counselors and a psychiatrist gave the teenager medication."He just quit talking about (being transgender)," she said.She worried Wednesday that hateful messages directed toward her and her husband are making them out to be "horrible people," she said. She has other children, she said, and they are incredibly sad about losing a sibling.She said that there has not been a service for the teen because people have threatened to protest.Her child came to her only once to talk about being transgender, Carla Alcorn insisted.The first time she heard the name Leelah was on the teen's suicide note."He never said that name before," she said.'The cruelty of loneliness'Leelah's suicide note, however, says she struggled for a long time to gain her parents' acceptance as a transgender teen."My mom started taking me to a therapist, but would only take me to christian therapists, (who were all very biased) so I never actually got the therapy I needed to cure me of my depression. I only got more christians telling me that I was selfish and wrong and that I should look to God for help."At 16, she wrote that she realized her "parents would never come around" and that she would have to wait until she was 18 to start any kind of medical treatment to transition to being a female.still upset about it, rest in power angel. we are doing everything to change this spiteful society &#128532;❤️ #LeelahAlcorn pic.twitter.com/csmIE8eJ0iThat, she said, "absolutely broke my heart. ... I felt hopeless, that I was just going to look like a man in drag for the rest of my life."Carla Alcorn recalled her teen asking for transition surgery.She told her child no, she said, because "we didn't have the money for anything like that."In her suicide note, Leelah said she cried herself to sleep that night.Leelah told her friends she was transgender.She came out as gay at school, a move that was supported by friends but made her parents angry, she wrote."They wanted me to be their perfect little straight christian boy, and that's obviously not what I wanted."Carla Alcorn said that she took away her child's access to social media because the teen was looking at "inappropriate" things on the Internet but would not say what those things were.inspired by leelah. rip angel &#128124;&#128150; #leelahalcorn pic.twitter.com/SX4wVQURRMLeelah describes what it was like to not have social media to connect with friends: "This was probably the part of my life when I was the most depressed, and I'm surprised I didn't kill myself. I was completely alone for 5 months. No friends, no support, no love. Just my parents' disappointment and the cruelty of loneliness."It all began to feel like too much weight to the teenager, she wrote. Convinced she had few friends, and feeling the pressure of saving enough money to move out of her home, keep her grades up and face people at church who she felt had only judgment for her, she decided to end her life."I'm never going to find a man who loves me," she wrote. "I'm never going to be happy."Give all of her things and money to the transgender civil rights movement and to transgender support groups, Leelah instructed."The only way I will rest in peace is if one day transgender people aren't treated the way I was, they're treated like humans, with valid feelings and human rights. Gender needs to be taught about in schools, the earlier the better. My death needs to mean something. My death needs to be counted in the number of transgender people who commit suicide this year. ... Fix society. Please."If you decide to bring a child into the world, the very least you can do is love them unconditionally #LeelahAlcornTwo days after the teen's death, grieving in that stomach-punch way that only parents who have to bury a child understand, Carla Alcorn kept repeating that she loved her child."He was an amazing musician and artist," she said. "He was an amazing boy."More education, time and compassionNot far from where the Alcorns live, Shane Morgan was thinking a lot about Leelah.The executive director of the Columbus-based advocacy group TransOhio said the teen's suicide evoked memories of what it was like 15 years ago when he struggled with telling friends and family he was transgender."I came out as gay. ... I didn't understand what gender identity was at that time," he said.As Morgan got older and met different people and had new experiences, he gained confidence and courage.He wrote a letter to his family and friends, telling them he was transgender. With the exception of his father and brother, he said, everyone was loving.Morgan said he understands the anger some people feel toward Leelah's parents, but "there's no excuse for threats to the family."The transgender life: What to know, say and understandSince Leelah's death, parents of transgender children have sent TransOhio photos and letters saying how much the tragedy has shaken them and that they love and accept their children no matter what.Their greatest fear is that their child will feel unloved. And statistics show that that can lead to suicides like Leelah's.A 2011 study by the National Center for Transgender Equality found that 41% of 6,450 responding transgender and gender nonconforming people had attempted suicide.If he could have talked to Leelah, Morgan would have said that he understood how tough it is and how awful it feels. He would have told her that when she got a little bit older, she would be freer to adopt another kind of family -- one of friends who would accept and cherish her."I wouldn't have told her that it gets better, but it changes," he said. "There are people she could have met. I don't know if she ever met a transgender person. But she could have seen something else. She could have been given some hope."The appropriate response to your child coming out as lesbian, gay, bi or trans is I LOVE YOU. That's all you need to say! #LeelahAlcorn &#128542;Aidan Key also knows well what it's like to endure a transgender adolescence. The founder of the family education and support organization Gender Diversity in Washington grew up in a fundamentalist Christian household and now works with families with deep religious beliefs to help them understand what being transgender means.He considers himself lucky to have a mother and twin sister who adored him regardless of his gender identity."My compassion is there for the parents. All any parent wants is love for their children, for their children to live good lives. Transgender is such a new thing in society, and we've not faced it or discussed it as a society. We've kept it in a dark corner where some people still think it's some deviant sexual behavior," said Key."If the parents would have reached out for more information or said 'This is a lot. We need some time,' or if they had access to a group that would welcome them to talk, that might have made the difference for Leelah."Opinion: What transgender teen's death should show us</p>

<p>(CNN) -- The father-in-law of a mother fatally shot in an Idaho Walmart by her 2-year-old son says she didn't have a mean bone in her body."Everybody that met her, knew her, loved her," Terry Rutledge said about Veronica Rutledge, 29.She died Tuesday after her young son shot her accidentally while they were out shopping with other family members, authorities said.Rutledge -- who put herself through school and was a chemical engineer -- "was a fun-loving, outgoing, outdoorsy person," said Terry Rutledge. "Her family liked to camp, hike, do outdoorsy things. They loved being together," he said.He said that Veronica Rutledge had carried a gun for years and had extensive training."I cannot put any blame on my daughter-in-law because I know her, the training she's had ... I don't take it lightly ... I cannot put any negligence on her part. It was a terrible accident."Kootenai County Sheriff Ben Wolfinger revealed details of the accident following an autopsy on Wednesday.According to Wolfinger, the toddler removed the 9mm Smith &amp; Wesson semi-automatic handgun from his mother's new handbag, one that was "specifically designed for concealed carry of a firearm," he said."The 2-year old removed the firearm from the purse and fired one bullet from the pistol. The bullet struck Mrs. Rutledge in the head, killing her instantly."The store's manager, who was nearby at the time, "stepped in and removed the firearm from the child," Wolfinger said.CNN's Michael Martinez and Tony Marco contributed to this report.</p>

<p>(CNN) -- His name isn't as recognizable as Michael Brown's. But like Brown, Ezell Ford was an unarmed black man shot and killed by police in August.Now, newly released details of Ford's death could raise a host of new questions.Among the findings: The 25-year-old was shot three times, including once in the back. And that wound was surrounded by a muzzle imprint, Ford's autopsy report shows.But "there is nothing in the coroner's report that is inconsistent with the statements given to us by the officers," Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck said.Ford was shot by Los Angeles police on August 11 -- two days after Brown was killed.The Los Angeles County coroner's office released the autopsy Monday after the Los Angeles police removed its security hold on it.The LAPD had put an administrative hold on Ford's autopsy because the department said it wanted witnesses to come forward before the autopsy's release.What happened?The circumstances leading up to Ford's death aren't exactly clear.According to one of the officers involved, he and Ford got into a "violent struggle," Beck said.Ford ended up on top of the officer, with Ford in control of the officer's pistol, the police chief said."The officer drew his backup gun and reached over Mr. Ford's back and shot Mr. Ford in very close proximity -- possibly, probably the cause of the muzzle imprint that's mentioned in the coroner's report," Beck said.Ford's family has said he was mentally ill and unarmed.The police chief said the investigation is far from over."We continue to seek the public's assistance. Any information regarding this incident will help us complete this picture," Beck said.He said police have not been able to reach any civilian witnesses who actually saw the shooting."We still are searching for witnesses. We still are looking for other versions of events."He said the district attorney will make the final determination about whether the shooting met legal standards.Before the autopsy's release, a Los Angeles community leader wondered how the shooting could be justified."How do you explain when you have this level of deadly force against those that are not even accused of committing a crime and are not even armed?" asked Earl Ofari Hutchinson of the Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable.The two officers involved have been assigned to non-field duties as the investigation continues.CNN's Cheri Mossberg and Stephanie Elam contributed to this report.</p>
