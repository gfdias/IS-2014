        <content>(CNN) -- The two young women are seen in Islamic garb with only their faces showing. They appear to be seated against a wall. One reads a brief statement in English, which includes: "We are in big danger and we could be killed."The statement identifies them as Greta Ramelli and Vanessa Marzullo. Two young Italian women by those names -- ages 20 and 21 -- went missing and were believed kidnapped after they traveled to Syria in late July."I have no doubt that it's them," Vanessa's father Salvatore Marzullo told CNN of the video posted online Thursday. Some postings say the video is from al Qaeda affiliate Jabhat al-Nusra.One of the young women holds a paper suggesting that the video was shot December 17."We supplicate our government and its mediators to bring us back home before Christmas. We are in big danger and we could be killed. The government and its mediators are responsible of our lives," the other says, reading the statement.Italian intelligence sources consider the video to be authentic, according to the state-run ANSA news agency."These women are shouting for help, they are sending out an SOS," said Laura Boldrini, speaker of the Italian Chamber of Deputies. She added, "We do not know how reliable this video is, but the situation of these two women is distressing."The Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs declined to comment on the video.An Italian intelligence source told ANSA news agency that authorities are in a "very delicate moment that requires maximum discretion."</content>

        <author>By Laura Smith-Spark, CNN</author>
        <content>(CNN) -- It's been a bloody year in Iraq, where ISIS militants have seized swaths of territory and remain on the offensive. And the latest figures from the Iraq Body Count monitoring project show that civilians, as so often in war, are paying a heavy price.At least 17,049 civilians were recorded killed in Iraq during 2014, Iraq Body Count said, roughly double the number recorded in 2013 -- which in turn was about double that of the previous year.The shocking rise in deaths in 2014 is due in large part to the ISIS offensive and the military response to it by Iraqi forces and the U.S.-led international coalition, the group said.Based in London and made up of academics and human rights and anti-war activists, Iraq Body Count monitors and compiles media reports of Iraqi civilian casualties resulting from the violence that followed the U.S.-led 2003 invasion of Iraq.Since that invasion, "not a single day has passed without Iraqi civilians being killed," it said. "The year 2014, however, reflects an increase in violence to levels not seen since the worst years of 2006 and 2007."According to the group, the greatest number of deaths in 2014 were in Baghdad, Nineveh, Salaheddin and Anbar provinces, which together account for about 80% of civilian deaths.The highest number of civilian deaths was seen in Baghdad, with more than 4,750 reported.More than 3,600 civilians were killed in western Anbar province, half of them by the Iraqi military in daily airstrikes, primarily in and around Falluja, the group said.Meanwhile, in Salaheddin and Nineveh provinces, the killings of civilians by ISIS contributed significantly to the death toll, it said.From 2010 to 2012, there was a relative reduction in civilian casualties, but the level of violence in the country started to climb again in 2013, Iraq Body Count said. That rise followed the withdrawal of U.S. troops at the end of 2011 and the implementation of increasingly sectarian policies by the then-Shia-led government.There has been no monthly civilian death toll lower than 900 since July 2013, the group said, with most being much higher.'New brutality on the ground'The bloodshed peaked in June, when ISIS launched a major offensive to take Iraq's second-largest city, Mosul, and extend its reach far into the country. There were 2,534 civilian deaths recorded that month.Since then, the average has been more than 1,500 civilian deaths a month.It's not always possible to tell who's to blame for the deaths.But according to Iraq Body Count's analysis, 1,748 civilians were reported killed by Iraqi military airstrikes, while 4,325 were killed by ISIS. There were also 118 civilians reported killed by U.S. coalition airstrikes last year."There is a new brutality on the ground and renewed attacks from the air. ISIS and the Iraqi army have caused thousands of civilian deaths this year, while the international coalition has yet again been responsible for civilian killings, for the first time since U.S. withdrawal three years previously," Iraq Body Count said."Iraqi civilians are once again being killed by all sides."Combatant deathsAs for those taking part in the fighting, it's hard to say with certainty how many have died, the group said.Iraqi military and insurgent deaths have increased "dramatically" in 2014 in relation to previous years, it said.But there's also been a sharp divergence in the information coming from different sources, such as news agencies, official statistics and media reports -- giving a total ranging from 4,000 to 5,000 at the low end to roughly 30,000 at the other extreme."The truth probably lies somewhere between these two numbers, but neither can be ruled out at present," Iraq Body Count said.Taking that variation into account, between 21,000 and 47,000 people were killed in war-related violence in Iraq during 2014, it said. That makes it the third-deadliest year since the invasion, after 2006 and 2007.</content>

Security Council rejected a resolution calling for Palestinian statehood by 2017, and for Israel to withdraw from the West Bank and East Jerusalem. It sets the stage for the Palestinian Authority to possibly pursue war crime complaints against Israel."This is another step forward. Legally, it gives anyone the opportunity to raise claims to the ICC and for the ICC to do work here. We are opening a door," said Xavier Abu Eid, spokesman for the Palestine Liberation Organization."It is not, necessarily, that the state of Palestine will raise a claim against Israel, but that basically now, anyone can. If any events take place here, then they can do work here, and likewise anyone -- from individuals, NGOs, churches, etc. -- can raise claims. It's important to remember that settlements are on occupied Palestinian lands and are illegal," he said.The U.S. State Department said it was "deeply troubled" by the development, calling it an "escalatory step.""Today's action is entirely counterproductive and does nothing to further the aspirations of the Palestinian people for a sovereign and independent state. It badly damages the atmosphere with the very people with whom they ultimately need to make peace," the State Department said."While we are under no illusions regarding the difficult road of negotiations, direct negotiations are ultimately the only realistic path for achieving the aspirations of both peoples. All of us would like to see the day when that effort can resume, and can lead to the peace that we all know is the only real, sustainable answer to the underlying causes of this conflict," the statement read.CNN's Irene Nasser and Elise Labott contributed to this report.</content>

        <content>(CNN) -- Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz was admitted to a hospital Wednesday for medical tests, according to a statement from the royal court cited by the state-run Saudi Press Agency.The King is in the National Guard Hospital in the capital, Riyadh, the statement said. It gave no further details of his health.According to the Saudi Embassy in Washington, Abdullah, 90, was born in Riyadh in 1924.He was named crown prince, or heir to the throne, in 1982 and succeeded King Fahd, his half-brother, on his death in 2005.He had in effect been running the country since Fahd had a stroke in 1996 -- and in nearly a decade of ruling on behalf of his brother, he began opening the door to reform.Since ascending to the throne, he has taken steps toward broader freedoms and has invested some of the country's vast oil wealth in large-scale education and infrastructure projects.However, resistance from conservative factions has hindered some of his efforts, leaving many women in particular disappointed by a lack of progress toward greater independence.Under Abdullah's leadership, the country has, though, slowly squashed al Qaeda, capturing or killing its leaders in the kingdom, forcing the remnants underground and sidelining radical preachers.It has also taken a more prominent role in international affairs and is a key U.S. ally in the region.Earlier this year, it became the lead Arab nation in a U.S.-led coalition to eradicate the ultra-radical ISIS group in Iraq and Syria.CNN's Salma Abdelaziz contributed to this report.</content>

        <content>Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- A huge explosion killed at least 23 people and wounded 48 others during a Houthi gathering in the central Yemeni province of Ibb on Wednesday, Yemen's Interior Ministry said.The explosion took place in the local cultural center, where the Houthis were preparing for the celebration of the Prophet Mohammed's birthday, which will take place Saturday.The governor of Ibb was present at the location of the attack but fled unharmed. The injured were taken to Al Thawra and Al Manar hospitals.Police officials said the number killed had risen from an earlier tally of 16 after several of the critically injured died from their wounds.According to one security official, a suicide bomber carried out the attack.No group has claimed responsibility for the bombing. Local security officials told CNN the attack had the hallmarks of al Qaeda.Yemen in midst of an upheavalHouthis follow the Zaidi sect of Islam and are considered Shiites by al Qaeda, a Sunni extremist group. There has been a series of recent attacks on Houthi targets across the country.The Houthis swept to power in Yemen after signing a ceasefire deal with the government in September, ending a political crisis that had halted life in the capital, Sanaa, and left more than 300 dead in a month.Its members have since installed themselves in key positions in the government and financial institutions.One month after signing the ceasefire deal, Houthis took control of large areas of the Sunni-dominated Ibb province, following weeks of clashes with militants. Dozens of fighters from both sides were killed in the fighting.CNN's Laura Smith-Spark contributed to this report.</content>

        <content>Abu Dhabi (CNN) -- "Do you know what the Islamic State (ISIS) will do with you?" members of the terrorist group's propaganda wing ask their captive, who appears to be wearing an orange jumpsuit. "Yes. They will kill me," the hostage replies.The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria has just published in its latest English-language magazine Dabiq what it claims is an "interview" with the Jordanian pilot captured in Syria.Militants say they downed an F-16 jet manned by Moaz al-Kassasbeh as he took part in U.S.-led coalition air strikes near ISIS's de-facto capital, Raqqah, last week. Images provided by the extremist organization's media wing and circulated widely on social media showed bearded men with Kalashnikovs pulling the terrified airman out of a nearby river."We entered the region of Raqqah to sweep the area, then the striker jets entered to begin their attack," al-Kassasbeh said, according to the online publication. "My plane was struck by a heat-seeking missile. I heard and felt its hit."The Jordanian government and U.S. Central Command described the incident as an aircraft crash and adamantly stated that it was not shot down by ISIS."I checked the system display and it indicated that the engine was damaged and burning," the pilot is quoted as saying. "The plane began to deviate from its normal flight path, so I ejected. I landed in the Furat River by parachute and the seat caught on some ground, keeping me fixed, until I was captured by soldiers of the Islamic State."A still image of al-Kassasbeh wearing the orange jumpsuit tops the short article titled: "The Capture of the Crusader Pilot." Journalist James Foley, American NGO founder Peter Kassig, and British aid worker Alan Henning among other hostages wore similar outfits in videos purporting to show their murders at the hands of the extremists.The magazine also contains an article claimed to have been authored by British hostage John Cantlie, headlined "Meltdown." The article suggests the world is facing economic collapse and says "it makes enormous sense for the Islamic State to mint their own gold dinars." Cantlie was a photojournalist and freelance writer for major British newspapers, before he was kidnapped in November 2012 along with American journalist James Foley, who was also killed by ISIS militants.The family of the captured Jordanian pilot have made several emotional pleas for his release and called on the Jordanian government to launch an investigation into the crash."Be supportive of our brother Moaz and to be merciful on him, please send him back to us," Jawad al-Kassasbeh told CNN Arabic last Friday. "He is just a soldier who is following orders and has no authority."Jordan, is one of several nations participating in an American-led mission against ISIS, an organization which is seeking to establish a Caliphate, or Islamic State, and has wrested territory spanning from central Syria to about 100km (62 miles) north of Baghdad.The United Nations says the group's acts of brutality, including the enslavement of women, mass killing, and the torture and imprisonment of its enemies, amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity.</content>

        <content>Abu Dhabi (CNN) -- In a series of blunt tweets over the holiday weekend, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei entered America's debate on race and police violence -- comparing unrest in states like New York and Missouri to conflicts in the Middle East.#Jesus endured sufferings to oppose tyrants who had put humans in hell in this world&amp; the hereafter while he backed the oppressed. #FergusonOn Sunday he tweeted: "#Jesus endured sufferings to oppose tyrants who had put humans in hell in this world&amp; the hereafter while he backed the oppressed. #Ferguson"Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the country's chief political and religious authority, acknowledged the role of Jesus in Islamic theology and compared the biblical prophet's struggle to that of black people in the United States.The tweet included #BlackLivesMatter, a hashtag popularized in recent weeks by supporters of Eric Garner, a 43-year old African-American man that died after being put in a chokehold by a NYPD officer.It's expected that followers of #Jesus follow him in his fight against arrogants and in his support for the oppressed. #BlackLivesMatterIt read: "It's expected that followers of #Jesus follow him in his fight against arrogants and in his support for the oppressed. #BlackLivesMatter"On Christmas Eve, the Ayatollah lumped the struggle of Palestinians in the Gaza strip with protests in Ferguson, Missouri, where black teenager Michael Brown was shot dead by police, and called on members of all three monotheistic faiths to stand-up against oppression.#Jesus like all prophets was herald of monotheism&amp; human dignity; nowadays humanity needs this message more than ever.#Ferguson #Gaza 1/1/93The tweet said: "#Jesus like all prophets was herald of monotheism&amp; human dignity; nowadays humanity needs this message more than ever.#Ferguson #Gaza 1/1/93"The unverified Twitter account, widely accepted as the mouthpiece of the Ayatollah's social media campaign, often posts diatribes against the West and Israel to its more than 91,000 followers.In August of this year, the leader published a poignant image that criticized President Barack Obama's support for Israel during the country's military operation to debilitate Hamas, a group many Western nations including the U.S. designate as a terrorist organization.US govt has subjugated a great nation w/ massive resources to a criminal regime like #Israel.10/31/12 #Ferguson #Gaza pic.twitter.com/XU3dJgkVsp"US govt has subjugated a great nation w/ massive resources to a criminal regime like #Israel.10/31/12 #Ferguson #Gaza," it said.In response, some Twitter users accused the Ayatollah of hypocrisy, and tweeted him with hashtags such as #AllLivesMatter, #GayLivesMatter and #KurdishLivesMatter.Human rights groups and observers regularly criticize the country for its poor record on executions, the treatment of political prisoners, and women.In its 2013 report on Iran, Human Rights Watch said: "Many civil society activists remained in prison on political charges. Authorities regularly subjected prisoners, especially those convicted on politically motivated charges, to abuse and deprive them of necessary medical treatment."Iranian women continued to face discrimination in many areas including personal status matters. Authorities restricted political participation and employment of minority groups, who account for about 10% of the population."2013: Iran reaches out on Twitter at Christmas</content>

        <content>(CNN) -- A suicide bomber wearing an explosive vest blew himself up among mourners inside a funeral tent on a farm about 12 miles north of Baghdad, Iraq, on Monday, according to police.At least 21 people were killed and 35 others injured at the funeral in al Taji, a mostly Sunni district, officials said.The funeral was for a member of the local Awakening Council, a group also known as the Sons of Iraq and Sahawat, made up of Sunni Arab fighters who turned against al Qaeda.Iraqi security forces believe that ISIS militants were behind the attack.Awakening Councils are U.S.-backed groups that have been active in Iraq since 2006. A few years ago, the councils were credited as being a major factor in a drop in violence across Iraq, but council members have also become targets for jihadists.</content>

        <content>(CNN) -- The Syrian government is ready to send envoys to Moscow for talks with representatives of the opposition it has been fighting in a brutal civil war for over 3½ years, according to state-run media.The government of President Bashar Al-Assad wants to find a way out of the conflict in the country, state-news agency SANA said Saturday.But moderate opposition groups say they have not been invited to the talks by Russia and will not participate, according to Oubai Shahbandar with the Syrian National Coalition, the main opposition group recognized by the United States, the United Nations and Russia.He said Moscow invited only loyalists groups that are close to the Syrian regime.The meeting is expected to take place after January 20 in Moscow and will be "informal," Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Alexander Lukashevich said earlier this week, according to Russian state news agency Itar-Tass."Negotiators have been named; they are the foreign minister and the first deputy ... but it is up to Syria's authorities to decide on the format for the delegation to be sent for Moscow's consultative meeting," the spokesman said.The Syrian National Coalition says any meaningful talks must be held on the basis of the Geneva communique that was agreed upon by the United States, United Nations and Russia.Negotiations in Geneva, brokered by the United Nations, fell apart in February. At the time, U.N. mediator Lakhdar Brahimi apologized to the Syrian people, saying he was "very, very sorry" that, despite two rounds of talks, "we haven't done very much."Since then, the extremist group ISIS has become a growing force in northern Syria and al Qaeda-linked Al Nusra Front has made gains, weakening more moderate opposition groups.U.S. options in Syria shrivel as Islamists gainPierre Meilhan and and Anna Maja Rappard contributed to this story</content>
